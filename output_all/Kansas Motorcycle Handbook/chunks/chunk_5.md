## Helmet Selection
There are two primary types of helmets, providing two different levels of coverage: three-quarter and full face.
Whichever style you choose, you can get the most protection by making sure that the helmet:
1. Meets U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and state standards. Helmets with a label from the Snell Memorial Foundation give you an added assurance of quality.
2. Fits snugly, all the way around.
3. Has no obvious defects such as cracks, loose padding or frayed straps.
Whatever helmet you decide on, keep it securely fastened on your head when you ride. Otherwise, if you are involved in a crash, it's likely to fly off your head before it gets a chance to protect you.
