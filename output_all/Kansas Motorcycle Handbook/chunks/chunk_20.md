See
Good, experienced riders remain aware of what is going on around them. They improve their riding strategy by using SEE, a three-step process used to make appropriate judgments, and apply them correctly in different traffic situations: Search
Evaluate
Execute
Search
Search aggressively ahead, to the sides and behind to avoid potential hazards even before they arise. How assertively you search, and how much time and space you have, can eliminate or reduce harm. Focus even more on finding potential escape routes in or around intersections, shopping areas and school and construction zones. Be especially alert in areas with limited visibility. Visually "busy" surroundings could hide you and your motorcycle from others.
Search for factors such as:
1. Oncoming traffic that may turn left in front of you
2. Traffic coming from the left and right
3. Traffic approaching from behind
4. Hazardous road conditions
Evaluate
Think about how hazards can interact to create risks for you. Anticipate potential problems and have a plan to reduce risks.
1. Road and surface characteristics - Potholes, guardrails, bridges, telephone poles and trees won't move into your path but may influence your riding strategy.
2. Traffic control devices - Look for traffic signals, including regulatory signs, warning signs, and pavement markings, to help you evaluate circumstances ahead.
3. Vehicles and other traffic - May move into your path and increase the likelihood of a crash.
Think about your time and space requirements to maintain a margin of safety. You must leave yourself time to react if an emergency arises.
