## Borrowing and Lending
Borrowers and lenders of motorcycles, beware. Crashes are common among beginning riders, especially in the first months of riding. Riding an unfamiliar motorcycle adds to the problem. If you borrow a motorcycle, get familiar with it in a controlled area. If you lend your motorcycle, make sure the operator is licensed and knows how to ride before allowing them on the road.
No matter how experienced you may be, ride extra carefully on any motorcycle that's new or unfamiliar to you. More than half of all crashes occur on motorcycles ridden by the operator for less than six months.
Get Familiar with the Motorcycle Controls
Make sure you are completely familiar with the motorcycle before you take it on the street. Be sure to review the owner's manual. This is particularly important if you are riding a borrowed motorcycle.
If you are going to use an unfamiliar motorcycle:
1. Make all the checks you would on your own motorcycle.
2. Find out where everything is, particularly the turn signals, horn, headlight switch, fuel-supply valve and engine cut-off switch. Find and operate these items without having to look for them.
3. Know the gear pattern. Work the throttle, clutch and brakes a few times before you start riding. All controls react a little differently.
4. Ride very cautiously and be aware of surroundings. Accelerate gently, take turns more slowly and leave extra room for stopping.
