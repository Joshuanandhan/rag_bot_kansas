# Kansas Motorcycle Handbook
![NOES OF THE STATE VALA AD ASTRA PER ASPERA ARAL STAT JANUARY 29, 1861]()
Operating a motorcycle safely in traffic requires special skills and knowledge. The Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) has made this manual available to help novice motorcyclists reduce their risk of having a crash. The manual conveys essential safe riding information and has been designed for use in licensing programs. While designed for the novice, all motorcyclists can benefit from the information this manual contains.
The original Motorcycle Operator Manual was developed by the National Public Services Research Institute (NPSRI) under contract to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and within the terms of a cooperative agreement between NHTSA and the MSF. The manual and related tests were used in a multi-year study of improved motorcycle operator licensing procedures, conducted by the California Department of Motor Vehicles under contract to NHTSA.
The purpose of this manual is to educate the reader to help avoid crashes while safely operating a motorcycle. For this edition, the MSF has updated and expanded the content of the original manual.
These revisions reflect:
·
The latest finding of motorcycle safety research.
· Comments and guidance provided by the motorcycling, licensing and traffic safety communities. Expanded alcohol and drug information. ·
In promoting improved licensing programs, the MSF works closely with state licensing agencies. The Foundation has helped more than half the states in the nation adopt the Motorcycle Operator Manual for use in their licensing systems.
Improved licensing, along with high-quality motorcycle rider education and increased public awareness, has the potential to reduce crashes. Staff at the Foundation are available to assist state, private and governmental agencies in efforts to improve motorcycle safety.
