## Tire Failure
You will seldom hear a tire go flat. If the motorcycle starts handling differently, it may be a tire failure. This can be dangerous. You must be able to tell from the way the motorcycle reacts. If one of your tires suddenly loses air, react quickly to keep your balance. Pull off and check the tires. If the front tire goes flat, the steering will feel "heavy." A front-wheel flat is particularly hazardous because it affects your steering. You have to steer well to keep your balance. If the rear tire goes flat, the back of the motorcycle may jerk or sway from side to side.
If either tire goes flat while riding:
1. Hold handle grips firmly, ease off the throttle, and keep a straight course.
2. If braking is required, however, gradually apply the brake of the tire that isn't flat, if you are sure which one it is.
3. When the motorcycle slows, edge to the side of the road, squeeze the clutch and stop.
