## Crash Avoidance
No matter how careful you are, there will be times when you find yourself in a tight spot. Your chances of getting out safely depend on your ability to react quickly and properly. Often, a crash occurs because a rider is not prepared or skilled in crash avoidance maneuvers. Two skills critical in avoiding a crash is knowing when and how to stop or swerve. It is not always desirable or possible to stop quickly to avoid an obstacle. Riders must also be able to swerve around an obstacle. Deter-mining which skill is necessary for the situation is important as well.
Studies show that most crash involved riders:
1. Underbrake the front tire and overbrake the rear.
2. Did not separate braking from swerving or did not choose swerving when it was appropriate. The following information offers some good advice.
