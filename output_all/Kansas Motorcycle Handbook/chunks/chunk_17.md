## Lane Sharing
Cars and motorcycles need a full lane to operate safely. Lane sharing is usually prohibited. Riding between rows of stopped or moving cars in the same lane can leave you vulnerable to the unexpected. A hand could come out of a window; a door could open; a car could turn suddenly. Discourage lane sharing by others. Keep a center portion position whenever drivers might be tempted to squeeze by you.
Drivers are most tempted to do this:
1. In heavy, bumper-to-bumper traffic
2. When they want to pass you
3. When you are preparing to turn at an intersection
4. When you are moving into an exit lane or leaving a highway
