## Wobble
A "wobble" occurs when the front wheel and handlebars suddenly start to shake from side to side at any speed. Most wobbles can be traced to improper loading, unsuitable accessories or incorrect tire pressure. If you are carrying a heavy load, lighten it. If you can't, shift it. Center the weight lower and farther forward on the motorcycle. Make sure tire pressure, spring pre-load, air shocks and dampers are at the settings recommended for that much weight. Make sure windshields and fairings are mounted properly.
Check for poorly adjusted steering; worn steering parts; a front wheel that is bent, misaligned, or out of balance; loose wheel bearings or spokes; and worn swingarm bearings. If none of these is determined to be the cause, have the motorcycle checked out thoroughly by a qualified professional.
Trying to accelerate out of a wobble will only make the motorcycle more unstable. Instead:
1. Grip the handlebars firmly, but don't fight the wobble.
2. Close the throttle gradually to slow down. Do not apply the brakes; braking could make the wobble worse.
3. Move your weight as far forward and down as possible.
4. Pull off the road as soon as you can to fix the problem.
