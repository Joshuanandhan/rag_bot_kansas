## Consequences of Conviction
Years ago, first offenders had a good chance of getting off with a small fine and participation in alcohol- abuse classes. Today the laws of most states impose stiff penalties on drinking operators, and those penalties are mandatory, meaning that judges must impose them.
If you are convicted of riding under the influence of alcohol or drugs, you may receive any of the following penalties:
1. License Suspension - Mandatory suspension for conviction, arrest or refusal to submit to a breath test.
2. Fines - Severe fines are another aspect of a conviction, usually levied with a license suspension.
3. Community Service - Performing tasks such as picking up litter along the highway, washing cars in the motor-vehicle pool or working at an emergency ward.
4. Costs - Additional lawyer's fees to pay, lost work time spent in court or alcohol-education programs, public transportation costs (while your license is suspended) and the added psychological costs of being tagged a "drunk driver."
Minimize the Risk
Your ability to judge how well you are riding is affected first. Although you may be performing more and more poorly, you think you are doing better and better. The result is that you ride confidently, taking greater and greater risks. Minimize the risks of drinking and riding by taking steps before you drink. Control your drinking or control your riding.
Don't Drink
Once you start, your resistance becomes weaker. Setting a limit or pacing yourself are poor alternatives at best. Your ability to exercise good judgment is one of the first things affected by alcohol. Even if you have tried to drink in moderation, you may not realize to what extent your skills have suffered from alcohol's fatiguing effects.
1. Don't Ride - If you haven't controlled your drinking, you must control your riding.
2. Leave the motorcycle - so, you won't be tempted to ride. Arrange another way to get home.
3. Wait - If you exceed your limit, wait until your system eliminates the alcohol and its fatiguing effects.
People who have had too much to drink are unable to make a responsible decision. It is up to others to step in and keep them from taking too great a risk. No one wants to do this, as it can be uncomfortable, embarrassing and thankless. You are rarely thanked for your efforts at the time. But the alternatives are often worse.
There are several ways to keep friends from hurting themselves:
1. Arrange a safe ride - Provide alternative ways for them to get home.
2. Slow the pace of drinking - Involve them in other activities.
3. Keep them there - Use any excuse to keep them from getting on their motorcycle. Serve them food and coffee to pass the time. Explain your concerns for their risks of getting arrested or hurt or hurting someone else. Take their key, if you can.
4. Get friends involved - Use peer pressure from a group of friends to intervene.
It helps to enlist support from others when you decide to step in. The more people on your side, the easier it is to be firm and the harder it is for the rider to resist. While you may not be thanked at the time, you will never have to say, "If only I had ... "
