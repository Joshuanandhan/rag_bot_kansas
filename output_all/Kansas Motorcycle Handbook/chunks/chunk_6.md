## Eye and Face Protection
A plastic shatter-resistant face shield can help protect your whole face in a crash. It also protects you from wind, dust, dirt, rain, insects and pebbles thrown up from cars ahead. These problems are distracting and can be painful. If you must deal with them, you can't devote your full attention to the road.
Goggles protect your eyes, though they won't protect the rest of your face like a face shield does. A windshield is not a substitute for a face shield or goggles. Most windshields will not protect your eyes from the wind. Neither will eyeglasses or sunglasses. Glasses won't keep your eyes from watering, and they might blow off when you turn your head while riding.
To be effective, eye or face shield protection must:
1. Be free of scratches.
2. Be resistant to penetration.
3. Give a clear view to either side.
4. Fasten securely, so it does not blow off.
5. Permit air to pass through, to reduce fogging.
6. Permit enough room for eyeglasses or sunglasses, if needed.
Tinted eye protection should not be worn at night or any other time when little light is available.
