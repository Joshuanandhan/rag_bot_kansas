## Motorcycles Make Sense- So Does Professional Training
Motorcycles are inexpensive to operate, fun to ride and easy to park. Unfortunately, many riders never learn critical skills needed to ride safely.
Professional training for beginning and experienced riders prepares them for real-world traffic situations. Motorcycle Safety Foundation RiderCoursesSM teach and improve such skills as:
· Effective turning
· Braking maneuvers
· Protective apparel selection
· Obstacle avoidance
· Traffic strategies
· Maintenance

The information contained in this publication is offered for the benefit of those who have an interest in riding motorcycles.

Consult your local regulatory agencies for information concerning the operation of motorcycle in your area. Although the MSF will continue to research, field test and publish responsible viewpoints on the subject, it disclaims any liability for the views expressed herein.
