## Horn
Be ready to use your horn to get someone's attention quickly. It is a good idea to give a quick beep before passing anyone that may move into your lane. Here are some situations:
1. A driver in the lane next to you is driving too closely to the vehicle ahead and may want to pass.
2. A parked car has someone in the driver's seat.
3. Someone is in the street, riding a bicycle or walking.
In an emergency, press the horn button loud and long. Be ready to stop or swerve away from the danger. Keep in mind that a motorcycle's horn isn't as loud as a car's - therefore, use it, but don't rely on it. Other strategies may be appropriate along with the horn.
