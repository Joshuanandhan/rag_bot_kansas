## Blood Alcohol Concentration
Blood Alcohol Concentration or BAC is the amount of alcohol in relation to blood in the body. Generally, alcohol can be eliminated in the body at the rate of almost one drink per hour. But a variety of other factors may also influence the level of alcohol retained. The more alcohol in your blood, the greater the degree of impairment.
Three factors play a major part in determining BAC:
1. The amount of alcohol you consume
2. How fast you drink
3. Your body weight
Other factors also contribute to the way alcohol affects your system.
Your gender, physical condition and food intake are just a few that may cause your BAC level to be even higher, but the full effects of these are not completely known. Alcohol may still accumulate in your body even if you are drinking at a rate of one drink per hour. Abilities and judgment can be affected by that one drink. A 12-ounce can of beer, a mixed drink with one shot of liquor and a 5-ounce glass of wine all contains the same amount of alcohol. The faster you drink; the more alcohol accumulates in your body. If you drink two drinks in an hour, at the end of that hour, at least one drink will remain in your bloodstream.
Without considering any other factors, these examples illustrate why time is a critical factor when a rider decides to drink.
A person drinking:
- Seven drinks over the span of three hours would have at least four (7 - 3 = 4) drinks remaining in their system at the end of the three hours. They would need at least another four hours to eliminate the four remaining drinks before they consider riding.
- Four drinks over the span of two hours would have at least two (4- 2 = 2) drinks remaining in their system at the end of the two hours. They would need at least another two hours to eliminate the two remaining drinks before they consider riding.
There are times when a larger person may not accumulate as high a concentration of alcohol for each drink consumed, since they have more blood and other bodily fluids. However, because of individual differences it is better not to take the chance that abilities and judgment have not been affected. The real issue is not if you are legally intoxicated, impairment of judgment and skills begins well below the legal limit.
