## Execute
Carry out your decision.
To create more space and minimize harm from any hazard:
1. Communicate your presence with lights and/or horn
2. Adjust your speed by accelerating, stopping or slowing
3. Adjust your position and/or direction
Apply the "one step at a time" to handle two or more hazards. Adjust speed to permit two hazards to separate. Then deal with them one at a time as single hazards. Decision-making becomes more complex with three or more hazards. Weigh the consequences of each and give equal distance to the hazards.
In potential high-risk areas, such as intersections, shopping areas and school and construction zones, cover the clutch and both brakes to reduce the time you need to react.
