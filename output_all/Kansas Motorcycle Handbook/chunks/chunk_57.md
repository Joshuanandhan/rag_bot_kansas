## Equipment
Equipment should include:
1. A proper seat - large enough to hold both of you without crowding. You should not sit any farther forward than you usually do.
2. Footrests - for the passenger. Firm footing prevents your passenger from falling off and pulling you off, too.
3. Protective equipment - the same protective gear recommended for operators.
4. Adjust the suspension to handle the additional weight. You will probably need to add a few pounds of pressure to the tires if you carry a passenger. (Check your owner's manual for appropriate settings.) While your passenger sits on the seat with you, adjust the mirror and headlight according to the change in the motorcycle's angle.
Carrying Loads
Most motorcycles are not designed to carry much cargo. Small loads can be carried safely if positioned and fastened properly.
To maintain safety when carrying a load:
1. Keep the Load Low - Fasten loads securely or put them in saddlebags. Piling loads against a sissy bar or frame on the back of the seat raises the motorcycle's center of gravity and disturbs its balance.
2. Keep the Load Forward - Place the load over, or in front of, the rear axle. Tank bags keep loads forward but use caution when loading hard or sharp objects. Make sure the tank bag does not interfere with handlebars or controls. Mounting loads behind the rear axle can affect how the motorcycle turns and brakes. It can also cause a wobble.
3. Distribute the Load Evenly - Load saddlebags with about the same weight. An uneven load can cause the motorcycle to drift to one side.
4. Secure the Load - Fasten the load securely with elastic cords (bungee cords or nets). Elastic cords with more than one attachment point per side are more secure. A tight load won't catch in the wheel or chain, causing it to lock up and skid. Rope tends to stretch, and knots come loose, permitting the load to shift or fall.
5. Check the Load - Stop and check the load every so often to make sure it has not worked loose or moved.
