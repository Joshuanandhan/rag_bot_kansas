## Turning
Riders often try to take curves or turns too fast. When they can't hold the turn, they end up crossing into another lane of traffic or going off the road. Or, they overreact and brake too hard, causing a skid and loss of control. Approach turns and curves with caution.
Use four steps for better control:
1. SLOW - Reduce speed before the turn by closing the throttle and, if necessary, applying both brakes.
2. LOOK - Look through the turn to where you want to go. Turn just your head, not your shoulders, and keep your eyes level with the horizon.
3. PRESS - To turn, the motorcycle must lean. To lean the motorcycle, press on the handle grip in the direction of the turn. Press left - lean left - go left. Press right - lean right - go right. Higher speeds and/or tighter turns require the motorcycle to lean more.
4. ROLL - Roll on the throttle through the turn to stabilize the suspension. Maintain steady speed or accelerate gradually through the turn. This will help keep the motorcycle stable.
In normal turns, the rider and the motorcycle should lean together at the same angle.
In slow tight turns, counterbalance by leaning the motorcycle only and keeping your body straight.
