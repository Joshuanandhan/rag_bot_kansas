## Getting Off the Road
If you need to leave the road to check the motorcycle (or just to rest for a while), be sure you:
1. Check the roadside - Make sure the surface of the roadside is firm enough to ride on. If it is soft grass, loose sand or if you're just not sure about it, slow way down before you turn onto it.
2. Signal - Drivers behind might not expect you to slow down. Give a clear signal that you will be slowing down and changing direction. Check your mirror and make a head check before you take any action.
3. Pull off the road - Get as far off the road as you can. It can be very hard to spot a motorcycle by the side of the road. You don't want someone else pulling off at the same place you are.
4. Park carefully - Loose and sloped shoulders can make setting the side or center stand difficult.
