## Keep the Group Together
1. Plan - The leader should look ahead for changes and signal early so "the word gets back" in plenty of time. Start lane changes early to permit everyone to complete the change.
2. Put Beginners Up Front - Place inexperienced riders just behind the leader. That way the more experienced riders can watch them from the back.
3. Follow Those Behind - Let the tail ender set the pace. Use your mirrors to keep an eye on the person behind. If a rider falls behind, everyone should slow down a little to stay with the tail ender.
4. Know the Route - Make sure everyone knows the route. Then, if someone is separated, they won't have to hurry to keep from getting lost or taking a wrong turn. Plan frequent stops on long rides.
