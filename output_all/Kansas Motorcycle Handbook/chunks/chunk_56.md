## Riding with Passengers
Your motorcycle will respond more slowly with a passenger on board. The heavier your passenger, the longer it will take to slow down and speed up - especially on a light motorcycle.
Instructing Passengers
Even if your passenger is a motorcycle rider, provide complete instructions before you start. Tell your passenger to:
1. Get on the motorcycle only after you have started the engine
2. Sit as far forward as possible without crowding you
3. Hold firmly to your waist, hips, belts or to the bike's passenger handholds
4. Keep both feet on the footrests, even when stopped
5. Keep legs away from the muffler(s), chains or moving parts
6. Stay directly behind you, leaning as you lean
7. Avoid unnecessary talk or motion
