## The Right Motorcycle for You
First, make sure your motorcycle is right for you. It should "fit" you. Your feet should reach the ground while you are seated on the motorcycle.
At minimum, your street-legal motorcycle should have:
1. Headlight, taillight and brake light
2. Front and rear brakes
3. Turn signals
4. Horn
5. Two mirrors
