## Adjusting to Roadway Conditions
There are road conditions where to be safe you must reduce speed, such as reducing speed before a sharp curve, when the roadway is slippery or when there is a potential for animals standing on the roadway.
Curves - A vehicle can travel much faster in a straight line than it can in a curve. Maintain a safe speed through the curve and follow posted warning signs. It is easy to drive too fast in a curve due to the vehicle's momentum. If you drive too fast, the tires will lose traction because the vehicle's momentum wants to continue straight (inertia effect). Always reduce speed prior to entering the curve to a safe speed (a speed that allows you to apply slight and constant acceleration through the curve). Reduce speed more when traction is poor, when following other vehicles or when you cannot see the end of the curve. Hard braking after the entry to a curve could cause the vehicle tires to lose traction.

Slippery roads - Reduce speed at the first sign of rain, snow or sleet. Roadways are more slippery when it first starts to rain, snow or sleet as the water will mix with dirt, oil and other substances on the roadway. Since heat causes the oil in the asphalt roadway to come to the top of the surface, a sudden rain on a hot day can make the roadway pavement very slippery for the first few minutes. The surface is more slippery before the oil is washed off.
When the roadway is slippery, the tires do not grip as well as they do on a dry roadway; therefore, it will take longer to stop, and it will be harder to turn without skidding. On wet roadways you should reduce speed about 10 mph below recommended speeds to allow for additional stopping distance and potential traction loss while steering. If there is packed snow on the road, reduce your speed by half or more.
On ice-covered roadways, you must reduce your speed to allow for more space for stopping and recovering from traction loss caused by steering inputs. Vehicles in Kansas may be equipped with studded snow tires from November 1st to April 1st each year. If possible, do not drive on ice-covered roadways. Ice-covered roadways are especially dangerous due to the normal design for roadway drainage. Roadways are higher in the center and sloped to the side, causing a skidding vehicle to slide off the roadway into a guardrail or drainage ditch. Some roadway surfaces are more slippery during certain times or at certain places.
Some clues to help you spot slippery roads are:
· Shady spots can be ice-covered on cold, wet days because shade-covered areas often freeze first and dry out last on the roadway.
· The roadway pavement on bridges overpasses and underpasses can be ice-covered even when other roadway pavement is clean and clear of ice. Bridges do not have earth underneath them to help insulate them against the cold and can be colder and more ice-covered than other roadways.
· When the temperature is near the freezing point, ice-covered areas can become wet. Water over ice makes it more slippery than at temperatures well below freezing.
Water on the roadway - When it is raining, or the road is wet, modern tires have stable traction up to about 30 mph. However, as you go faster than 35 mph, the steering tires will start to ride up on any pooled water, similar to the action of water skis. This tire loss of roadway contact is called "hydroplaning." In a heavy rain, your tires can lose all traction with the road at 45-50 mph due to the water pushing against the tires as the vehicle is moving forward. Badly worn tires will lose traction at much lower speeds (25-30 mph). The best way to avoid traction loss from hydroplaning is to slow down in the rain or when the road is wet with pooled water or water puddles.
