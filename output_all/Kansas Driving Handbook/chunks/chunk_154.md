## Vision Limitations
When something is limiting how well you can see, it can be difficult to drive. The following are examples of when your vision may be limited and how to solve the problem of limited vision:
· It is harder to see at night. You must be closer to an object to see it at night than during the day. When driving at night, you must be able to stop within the distance you can see ahead with your headlights. Your lower beam headlights will let you see clearly about 150 to 200 feet ahead. Driving at a speed that allows you to stop within this distance is about 45 mph. Your high beam headlights will let you see clearly about 350 to 400 feet ahead. Driving at a speed that allows you to stop within this distance is about 65 mph. You need to increase your following distance by adding at least one additional second for night driving conditions and at least two additional seconds for driving on unfamiliar roadways at night. Keep in mind that headlights limit your visual skills. Reducing speed based on headlight distance is critical to avoiding night driving collisions.

· Adverse weather can reduce visibility rapidly. When you cannot see any farther than 100 feet ahead due to rain, snow, blowing dust, smoke, or thick fog, you cannot safely drive faster than 30 mph. When adverse weather limits visibility, you may not be able to see well enough to drive; therefore, you should pull off the roadway in a safe place and wait until it clears. When driving in fog, snow or heavy rain use your low beams and fog lights for best visibility, even during the day, and be alert for other drivers who may have forgotten to turn on their headlights.
· Bright sunlight in the early morning or late afternoon creates a glare when driving into the sun. Wearing sunglasses, keeping windows clean and using the vehicle's sun visors can reduce glare. If the sun is behind you, be aware that oncoming drivers may not be able to see your turn signals or your vehicle because of glare.
· You may not know what is on the other side of a hill or just around a curve, even if you have driven the road many times. If a vehicle is stalled on the road just over a hill or around a curve, you must be able to stop or move around the problem. Whenever coming to a hill or curve where visibility is limited by the roadway, adjust vehicle speed to prepare for a speed or position adjustment.
· Vehicles parked along the side of the road may block your view. People may be ready to get out of a vehicle or walk out from between parked vehicles. Give parked vehicles as much room as the lane allows.
· Drive at a speed where the vehicle can safely stop within the space in front of the vehicle. Use the minimum 3 second following interval, increasing the following interval by an additional second for any unusual weather or traffic conditions.
· You must not drive faster than the distance you can see ahead. Reduce speed or adjust lane position to allow for adequate braking and steering in case of unusual conditions including:
· Traffic congestion
· Hills and curves
· Weather limitations
