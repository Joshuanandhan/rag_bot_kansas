## Starting
Check the vehicle owner's manual for how to start the vehicle. Make sure the parking brake is set before you start the vehicle. If the vehicle has automatic transmission place your right foot on the brake pedal and check gear selector lever for park. If the vehicle has a manual transmission press the clutch to the floor with your left foot and put the gearshift lever in neutral. Place the key in the ignition and turn ignition switch to the on position. Check indicator lights and gauges (fuel level, ABS, air bags, etc.). Then turn the ignition switch to start, turn on the low beam headlights and lock the doors.
