## Space Behind Affects Your Following Interval
It is not always easy to maintain a safe following interval behind your vehicle. However, you can help keep the driver behind you at a safe distance by keeping a steady speed, signaling in advance, and keeping more space to the front of your vehicle before reducing speed or turning.
· If your vehicle is being followed too closely (less than two seconds) or "tailgated" by another driver and there is an empty lane, move over to the empty lane and allow a pass. If there is no empty lane, wait until the roadway ahead is clear, then reduce speed slowly to encourage the tailgater to drive around your vehicle. Never slow down quickly to discourage a tailgater, as this action will increase the risk of being hit from behind and could lead to aggressive driving.
· If your vehicle is being followed too closely increase your following distance by 2 to 3 seconds to allow for more time and space to stop. Doing so can help to lessen the risk of being rear-ended by the tailgater if you are required to stop suddenly.
