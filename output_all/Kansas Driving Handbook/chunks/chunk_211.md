## To help cut down on your driving and make trip planning easier:
· Take public transportation when it is available.
· Avoid driving during heavy traffic. It causes extra wear and tear on you and the vehicle.
· Use carpools or share rides whenever possible.
· Plan, and then combine your trips. Make a list of the things you need and the places you need to go. Go to as many places as possible on any one trip.
· Call ahead to make sure that they have what you need or that what you are picking up is ready.
By doing these things you can help cut down on the amount of traffic on the road, cut your travel costs and save yourself time and effort.
To prepare a vehicle for any trip be sure to check the important mechanical components such as windshields and windows, lights, tires, all fluid levels, belts, hoses, and brakes. Get a good night's sleep the night before the start of the trip.
Before going on a trip, consider the time of day to avoid congestion in city areas. Have a plan for the route including the route number, entrance and exit numbers of the final destination. Consider rest stops, fuel stops, food stops and potential construction areas. Take a map with routes highlighted or a description of a route written on paper as a reference.
Determine the number of miles to be traveled daily. The average number of miles driven on major highways is 100 to 110 miles every two hours with 10 to 15-minute breaks every 2 to 3 hours and 1 hour stops for meals. When traveling on secondary roads, which go through towns and cities or traveling through mountains, it will take longer to get to your destination.
If one person will be doing all the driving, 6 to 8 hours of driving in any one day should be considered the limit. When two or more persons can share the driving, total driving time should not exceed 10 to 11 hours. Avoid driving after dark when visibility is limited and particularly after 11 p.m. when you are more apt to fall asleep while driving.
Be prepared when going on any trip. Remember to take:
· An extra set of keys in case you lock your keys in the vehicle or lose them
· Insurance information in case you are in a crash
· Money for expected and unexpected travel expenses
· Vehicle owner's manual in case your vehicle breaks down
· Maps of local areas in case you get lost
