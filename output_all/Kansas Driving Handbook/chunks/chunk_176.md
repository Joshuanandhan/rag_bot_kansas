## Night Driving
Night driving creates a different set of problems for drivers. Driving at night is more hazardous and more difficult than daytime driving. You cannot see nearly as much with your headlights as you see in the daytime. Headlights limit your range of visibility. Here are some things you can do that will help you to see better at night:
· Use your high beams whenever there are no oncoming vehicles. High beams let you see twice as far as low beams
· Dim your high beams whenever you come within about a one-block distance of an oncoming vehicle. If a vehicle comes toward you with their high beams on, flash your headlights once quickly. If the driver fails to dim their lights, look toward the right side of the road to keep from being blinded by their headlights. Do not try to "get back" at the other driver by keeping your bright lights on. If you do, both of you may be blinded, possibly causing a crash. Use your low beams when following another vehicle, in heavy traffic, in fog, or when it is snowing or raining hard.
· Light from high beams will reflect, causing glare and making it more difficult to see ahead. Some vehicles have fog lights that you can use in fog, snow or rain.
· Avoid looking directly into oncoming headlights as this can cause momentary blindness from the glare.
· Develop the ability to glance well ahead of your headlight beams, looking for dark shapes on the roadway.
· Glance occasionally to the right and left to determine the location of the edge of the pavement and hazards that may come from the sides.
· Do not wear sunglasses or colored glasses when driving at night or on dark days. Colored lenses cause your eyes to adjust even more slowly and can reduce your vision.
