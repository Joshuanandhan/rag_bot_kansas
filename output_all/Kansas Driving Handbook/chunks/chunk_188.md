## Internal Inspection
· Vehicle Used for Driving Exam- The vehicle being used for the driving exam must meet the following criteria:
o All signals must be working
o All tires must be of safe condition
o Brake lights must be working
o Windshield and mirrors must be intact
o Horn must be working
o Tag must be valid
o Inside of vehicle must be a safe temperature
· If outside temperature is over 85ºF, air conditioner must work properly
· If outside temperature is between 75°F-85ºF, air conditioner must work properly, or passenger window must roll down.
" If outside temperature is under 45ºF, heater must work properly
· Seats and Safety Belts - Check that there are no broken seat frames and that the seats are firmly attached to the floor. Properly adjust the driver seat so you can reach the pedals and turn the steering wheel. Check for properly secured, mounted, and adjusted safety belt. Make sure the safety belt is not ripped or frayed and properly place the safety belt across your hips and shoulder. Seats must be securely fastened, safe to sit in and properly adjusted. To keep you safe and in control while you drive, safety belts must be available, in usable condition and properly fastened.
· Windows and Windshield - Check windows to make sure they are clear, have no obstructions or damage to the glass and can open and close properly. Also check the windshield to make sure it is clear and has no obstructions or damage to the glass. Cracks, stickers, glare, or dirt can cause you to lose sight of other traffic or changes in road conditions.
. Doors and Mirrors - Check that door(s) are not damaged and that they open, close and latch properly. Check that all internal and external mirrors and mirror brackets are securely mounted, not damaged and free of excessive dirt. Check mirrors for proper adjustment. It is important to check the doors on a vehicle because doors must close and latch properly to keep you safe while driving. It is important to check mirrors as they provide visibility to the sides and rear.
· Wipers and Washers - Check that wiper arms and blades are secure and not damaged and that the windshield wipers and washers operate correctly. It is important to make sure your windshield wipers are in good condition, because they improve visibility during rain and other adverse conditions. Worn blades reduce visibility, which makes it difficult to see.
· Heater/Air Conditioner/Defroster - Describe how the heater, air conditioner and defroster work. Test the defroster by activating the fan and placing your hand over the dashboard's vent to ensure it is working properly. It is important to make sure your defroster is working properly because it improves visibility, especially during cold weather.
· Horn - Check that the horn works. It is important to make sure it is working, because the horn is a device that must function properly to warn other roadway users (vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists) of your presence, if needed.
· Indicator Lights - Check that (dash) indicator lights for turn signals, hazard flashers and headlight high beams illuminate when corresponding lights are turned on. It is important to make sure your indicator lights work, because they help to warn you if external lights, such as turn signals and high beams are still active when not appropriate.
· Brake Lights - Turn on your car. Have a friend or parent stand behind the car. Step on the brake pedal. Does your friend see both lights? If not, you should replace the bulb or fuse. If you don't know how, get a professional to do it.
· Fuel Gauge - Check that there is a sufficient amount of fuel and that the gauge is not on empty. It is important to have fuel in your vehicle so the vehicle will start and drive properly.
