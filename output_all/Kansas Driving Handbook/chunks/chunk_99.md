## Other Lane Controls Shared Center Left Turn Lane:
On many streets where it is difficult to make a left turn safely, there is a shared left turn lane located in the middle of the roadway. The solid yellow centerline means you cannot use the center lane for passing. The broken yellow centerlines show that vehicles traveling in either direction may use the center lane only to make left turns. When using a shared left turn lane do not move into the lane too soon. The longer you stay in the lane, the more likely you will meet someone coming in the opposite direction. Watch for vehicles pulling out of entrances and side streets, and do not use a shared left turn lane for anything but turning left.
When using a shared center left turn lane you must check for vehicles ahead, check mirrors, signal left and check your left blind spot by looking over your shoulder. Steer smoothly into the shared center left turn lane and choose an appropriate gap in oncoming traffic to make the left turn.
