## Illegal Drugs
It is against the law to purchase, possess or consume illegal drugs. Illegal drugs can impact your driving and can affect your reflexes, judgment, vision, and alertness in ways similar to alcohol. For example, studies have shown that people who use marijuana make more mistakes, have more trouble adjusting to glare and get arrested for traffic violations more than other drivers. If you are found guilty of a drug-related charge of driving under the influence and it is your first conviction, you may be fined $750 - $1000 plus court costs. You could be sentenced to a minimum of 48 hours in jail or 100 hours of community service and your license will be suspended. You may also be subject to other criminal penalties. For second and subsequent convictions, the penalties are much worse.
