## Emotions
Emotions can have a great effect on your driving safely. They can interfere with your ability to think, can create mental distractions, increase risk taking, create a lack of attention, and can interrupt the ability to process information. You may not be able to drive well if you are overly worried, excited, afraid, angry, or depressed.
There are ways of dealing with your emotions:
路 If you are angry or excited, give yourself time to cool off. If necessary, take a short walk or nap, but stay off the road until you have calmed down.
路 If you are worried, down or are upset about something, try to keep your mind on your driving. Some drivers find that listening to the radio helps, as long as it is not distracting from safe driving.
路 If you are impatient, give yourself extra time for your driving trip. Leave a few minutes early. If you have plenty of time, you may tend not to speed or do other things that can get you a traffic ticket or cause a crash. For example, do not drive faster than the flow of traffic. Darting in and around other traffic can be fatal.
路 Have someone else drive.
