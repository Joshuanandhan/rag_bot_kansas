There are rules of the road that say where, when, who, what and how you can drive. Rules of the road are designed to keep traffic moving safely and include rights-of-way, traffic control devices and parking rules.
Right-Of-Way
Where vehicles or pedestrians are likely to meet one another and there are no signs or signals to regulate traffic flow, there are rules on who must yield the right-of-way. These rules tell who must wait in different traffic situations.
The law says who must yield the right-of-way to another roadway user; it does not give anyone the right- of-way. You must do everything possible you can to prevent striking a pedestrian, property, or another vehicle, regardless of the circumstances. You only gain the right-of-way when another roadway user gives you the right-of-way.
