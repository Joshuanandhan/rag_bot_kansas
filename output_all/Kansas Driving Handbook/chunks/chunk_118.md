Look to the rear - Besides watching traffic ahead of you, you must check traffic flow to the rear. You need to check to the rear more often when traffic is heavy. This is the only way you will know if someone is following too closely or coming up too fast. The searching process will give you time to change speed or change lanes avoiding any potential problems. It is very important to look for vehicles to the rear prior to changing lanes, slowing down, entering traffic from the side of a street, or driving down a long or steep hill.
When changing lanes - Prior to changing lanes, you must check for traffic in the lane you want to enter and behind your vehicle. Changing lanes may include changing from one travel lane to another, merging onto a roadway from an entrance ramp, moving onto a roadway from a yield intersection, or entering the roadway from the curb or shoulder. When changing lanes, you should:
路 Maintain a safe following distance and look in your rearview and side mirrors to make sure there are no vehicles in the lane or entering the lane you want to enter, and no driver is about to pass.
路 Check your "blind spots" by turning your head and looking over your shoulder in the direction you plan to move. Blind spots are areas around your vehicle that you cannot see with your mirrors. Be sure no one is Traditional Mirror Settings near the rear corners of your vehicle.
路 Since traffic ahead of you could stop suddenly while you are checking traffic to the sides, rear or over your shoulder look several times if you need to so you do not have to look too long at any one time.
路 Identify a 4 to 5 second gap in traffic, signal and look again in the direction of the lane change. Adjust speed and steer into lane. Cancel turn signal.

When you slow down - Use your mirrors to check behind your vehicle whenever you slow down. This is very important to check when you slow down quickly or at points where a following would not expect you to slow down, such as private driveways or parking spaces.
When going down a long or steep hill - Check your mirrors for vehicles approaching quickly when you are going down hills or mountains. Vehicles often build up speed going down a steep grade. Be alert for large trucks and buses that may be going too fast.
