## Exercises:
Forward Two-point Turnabout - You may be asked to pull forward into a driveway or alley (during the road test or in an off-street area marked by traffic cones and/or lines) until the back end of your vehicle passes the front set of cones and the vehicle is not in the roadway. You will then back the vehicle to the right into the street and drive forward out of the exercise area, returning to the area where you started. This exercise demonstrates your ability to execute a two-point turnabout and to utilize a street, alley or driveway to reverse the direction you are traveling on a two-lane road. Basic skills needed for this exercise consist of visual skills, judgment of space, use of mirrors and turn signals, steering, braking and acceleration control, etc. (See Figure 11.1).

Reverse Two-point Turnabout - You may be asked to drive past the entrance to a driveway or alley (during the road test or in an off-street area marked by traffic cones and/or lines) and back to the right into the street or alley until the front end of your vehicle clears the front set of cones and the vehicle is not in the roadway. You will then drive the vehicle to the left into the street, returning to the area where you started and then drive forward out of the exercise area. This exercise demonstrates your ability to execute a reverse two-point turnabout and to utilize a street, alley or driveway to reverse the direction you are traveling on a two-lane road. Basic skills needed for this exercise consist of backing skills, visual skills, judgment of space, use of mirrors and turn signals, steering, braking and acceleration control, etc. (See Figure 11.2).

Three-point Turnabout - You may be asked to drive forward into a three-point turnabout area (during the road test or in an off-street area marked by traffic cones and/or lines) and execute a three-point turnabout. This exercise demonstrates your ability to execute a three-point turnabout and to utilize a street to reverse the direction you are traveling on a two-lane road. Basic skills needed for this exercise consist of backing skills, visual skills, judgment of space, use of mirrors and turn signals, steering, braking and acceleration control, etc. (Figure 11.3).

Right-side Parallel Park - You may be asked to park in a parallel parking space that is on your right side. You are to drive past the parking space and back into it. You must get the vehicle completely within the parking space. Bring the vehicle within 12 inches of the curb side of the space without crossing side or rear boundaries marked by lines or cones. This exercise demonstrates your ability to parallel park a vehicle. This is an essential skill for parking. A parallel park is one of the best indicators that you have the basic skills necessary to safely operate a motor vehicle. Basic skills needed for this exercise consist of visual skills, judgment of space, use of mirrors and turn signals, steering, braking and acceleration control, etc. (See Figure 11.4).
