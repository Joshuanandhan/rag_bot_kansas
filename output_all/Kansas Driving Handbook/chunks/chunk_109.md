## Securing and Entering the Vehicle:
Always set your parking brake when you park. Then place the vehicle in gear if it has a manual transmission or in "park" if it has an automatic transmission.
路 Turn off your headlights and engine before removing your key.
路 Check your mirrors and traffic before opening the door. Shut the door as soon as you can after getting out.
路 Never leave the ignition keys in a parked vehicle. It is a good habit to lock the doors whenever you leave your vehicle.
路 When entering your vehicle on the street, approach the driver's door with your key in hand from the front of the vehicle to increase awareness of oncoming traffic.
Parking Downhill with/without a Curb - When parking your vehicle on a downhill, whether with a curb or without a curb bring the vehicle to a stop parallel to and within 12 inches of the curb or road edge. Turn the steering wheel sharply toward the edge or curb side of the roadway while moving slowly forward. Stop when the tire closest to the side of the road reaches the edge of the road or just as it touches the curb, using it as a block. This way, if your vehicle starts to roll down the hill, it will roll away from traffic.
Parking Uphill with a Curb - When parking your vehicle on an uphill with a curb, bring the vehicle to a stop parallel to and within 12 inches of the curb. Move slowly forward turning the steering wheel sharply away from the curb. Stop then allow the vehicle to roll slowly back until the tire touches the curb and stop. This way, if your vehicle starts to roll down the hill, it will roll away from traffic.
Parking Uphill Without a Curb - When parking your vehicle on an uphill and there is no curb, bring the vehicle to a stop parallel to and within 12 inches of the edge of the road. Move slowly forward turning the steering wheel sharply toward the edge of the road. Stop when the tire closest to the edge of the road reaches the edge of the road. This way, if your vehicle starts to move, it will roll away from traffic.
