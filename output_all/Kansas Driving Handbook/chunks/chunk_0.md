Kansas' approximately 141,000 miles of roads keep our state's economy moving between cities and towns - both rural and urban - and these roads help us stay connected.
Even more importantly, these roads are built to keep safe our state's most valuable assets- people like you.
As drivers, we also have a big responsibility for keeping our roads safe, and this handbook was created with that purpose in mind. Whether you are a new or experienced driver, it will help prepare you to successfully complete your driving test, which focuses on shared "rules of the road" that help us all drive safely.
One new item I want to highlight is the information about texting while driving. Because a growing number of traffic accidents and deaths have been caused by people sending text messages while driving, the Kansas Legislature updated our driving laws to prohibit this activity that can dangerously distract us from the road.
I invite you to visit our website, ksrevenue.gov, for answers to other questions you may have. The Kansas Department of Revenue strives to make your experience with the Division of Vehicles quicker, more user-friendly, and convenient. Our website gives you another way to take care of some services without leaving your house or waiting in lines.
Sincerely, Laura Kelly
Governor Laura Kelly
