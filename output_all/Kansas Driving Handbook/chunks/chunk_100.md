## Reversible Lanes:
In some areas, a shared center lane becomes a "reversible lane" during rush hours. The lanes may have double dashed yellow lines to either side. Signals above the lanes designate traffic flow in reversible lanes. Some travel lanes are designed to carry traffic in one direction at certain times and in the opposite direction at other times. Before entering the lane, check to see which lanes can be used at that time. A green arrow means you can use the lane beneath it; a red "X" means the lane is not available. A flashing yellow "X" means the lane is for turning only. A steady yellow "X" means that the use of the lane is changing, and you should move out of it as soon as it is safe to do so. Be careful when using reversible lanes. Drivers traveling in the other direction could enter your lane by mistake. Keep alert.
