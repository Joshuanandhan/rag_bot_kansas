• Reverse Two-Point Turnabout - To perform a reverse two-point turnabout signal your intention to turn right, stop and check traffic to the sides and rear of the vehicle. Move back until the rear bumper of the vehicle reaches the near edge of the driveway. While backing slowly, steer rapidly all the way to the right. As the vehicle centers in the driveway, straighten the wheels and stop. Shift to drive and check in both directions; if clear, signal and turn left into the proper lane and accelerate as appropriate.

Check in all directions for traffic, signal a right turn and shift to reverse. When the path is clear, move slowly back while turning the steering wheel quickly all the way to the right. As the vehicle centers in the nearest lane, straighten wheels, stop, shift to drive, cancel right signal and move forward.
