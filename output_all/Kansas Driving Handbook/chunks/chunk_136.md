## Risk Awareness
Identify the risks associated when you drive. Risks are created by:
· Your own limitations as a driver. Perhaps you are a new driver, or you do not see well at night. Not all people react to situations the same.
· The vehicle we drive has limitations. Larger vehicles can be less stable and have reduced visibility around the vehicle. Smaller vehicles are harder for other drivers to see.
· The environment we drive in has its own limitations (e.g., geographical or weather). Driving in areas where there are hills and mountains requires special skills. Urban or city driving has increased risks because many other people are using the roadway as well.
