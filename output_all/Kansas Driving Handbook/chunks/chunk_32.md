Required Noncommercial License Tests
Vision - All driver license applicants will have their vision screened at the Driver Licensing Station or present a Driver Licensing eye examination form completed in the last 90 days by a licensed Ophthalmologist or Optometrist. Vision must be at least 20/40 in one eye when screened at the Driver License Station. If corrective lenses are required to meet this standard, then a restriction will be placed on the driver's license and the applicant will be required to wear corrective lenses anytime they are driving. Those who do not pass the vision examination must take the Driver Licensing eye examination form and have it completed by a licensed Ophthalmologist or Optometrist. When this form is returned within 90 days of the eye exam, Driver Licensing may issue the driver's license, or require further testing, depending on the results of the exam. Vision form can be found on our website at https://www.ksrevenue.gov/pdf/dv124v.pdf.

The knowledge exam may be taken at the driver's license office or online at https://ks.knowtodrive.com.
