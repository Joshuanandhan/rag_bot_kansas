## TURNS ON MULTI-LANE ROADS (K.S.A. 8-1545)
In making a right turn from a four-lane divided highway, enter the right lane well in advance of the turn and make a tight turn into the right lane of the cross street.
For left turns, move near the center line or traffic divider and turn from the inside lane in a way that you will not swing wide and will enter the cross street just to the right of the center line.
Some intersections are marked to permit turns from more than one lane. You may make turns as indicated by signs or pavement markings.
