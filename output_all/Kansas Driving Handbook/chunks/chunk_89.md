Railroad Crossing Warning Signs - Many railroad crossings have signs or signals to caution you about highway-railroad grade crossings. Some common railroad crossing warning signs and signals are shown below.
· A round yellow warning sign with an "X" symbol and black "RR" letters is placed along the road prior to a highway-railroad grade crossing. The sign cautions you to slow down, look and listen for a train or railroad vehicle and be prepared to stop if a train is approaching.
· A white, X-shaped sign with "Railroad Crossing" printed on it is located at the highway-railroad grade crossing. You must wait for a train or railroad vehicle that is approaching the intersection. Your vehicle must remain behind the stop line or prior to the intersection until the intersection is clear.

· At highway-railroad grade crossings with more than one train track, the number of tracks will be posted. These signs warn you that there is more than one track and there may be more than one train crossing. Not all highway-railroad grade crossings with more than one train track will have these signs so it is important to check for more than one track, train, or railroad vehicle at each highway-rail grade crossings with more than one train track will have these signs so it is important to check for more than one track, train, or railroad vehicle at each highway-railroad grade crossing.

· At some highway-railroad grade crossings, in addition to the signs, you may see side-by-side lights that will flash alternately. When a train is approaching and lights are flashing you must stop prior to the stop line or gate crossing area. At some highway-railroad grade crossings a crossing gate will lower when a train is coming. You may not move around the gate until the gate is lifted or the lights have stopped. Some highway-railroad grade crossings also have a bell or a horn that will sound. You should not cross until the bell or horn has stopped.
Trains do not always have a set schedule so always expect a train at every highway-railroad grade crossing, even if you have never seen one at that crossing before. Trains cannot stop quickly due to the huge weight and size of the train and the speed of the train. A 100-car freight train traveling at 55 mph will need more than a mile to stop, which is about 18 football fields, once the train is set into emergency braking.

When you need to cross railroad tracks, look both ways and cross the tracks quickly, without stopping. If a train is crossing the highway, you must wait to cross a highway-railroad grade crossing until the train is well down the track or railroad devices, such as lights and gates indicate it is safe to cross. If you are approaching railroad tracks and you need to stop for traffic or a signal, stop at the stop line, prior to the railroad tracks. Never permit traffic conditions to trap you in a position where you have to stop on the tracks. Only proceed through a highway-railroad grade crossing if you are sure you can completely clear the crossing without stopping on the tracks. You must always yield the right-of-way to trains and railroad vehicles at highway-railroad grade crossings
It is wise not to shift gears when crossing railroad tracks just in case you might stall. If you do stall your vehicle when crossing railroad tracks, get everyone out of the vehicle and far away from the tracks, run in the direction from which the train is approaching. If you run in the same direction the train is traveling, when the train hits your vehicle you could be injured by flying debris. Call your local law enforcement agency for assistance. Remember trains are large, heavy and are moving faster than they look.
· Emergency Notification Systems (ENS): The Blue Emergency Notification System (ENS) sign is at every highway-rail grade crossing and provides the public with a 24/7/365 telephone number to call to report problems or emergencies at these railroad locations. ENS signs may be located either on the black and white cross buck or near the actual crossing. Information provided on the ENS sign is a toll-free dispatch number for each railroad, and directly below the dispatch number is a Department of Transportation number that identifies the exact location of the crossing in question. When called the emergency contact number is answered by railroad dispatchers. The information contained on the ENS sign enables the public to notify the railroad dispatcher responsible for the crossing and to identify the specific crossing in the event of an emergency. Because railroad dispatchers are the first line of defense when attempting to stop all train traffic at the crossing during
an emergency, it is important that they are immediately notified of any unsafe conditions. See Figure 6.1
