## Tire Blowout:
Tire blowout is a rapid deflation of air from the tire. If a front tire blows out, the vehicle will pull sharply in the direction of the blowout. If a rear tire blows out, the vehicle will wobble, shake and pull some in the direction of the blowout. If a tire blows out or suddenly goes flat:
· Grip the steering wheel firmly and keep the vehicle going straight.
· Slow down gradually. Take your foot off the accelerator pedal.
· Do not brake. Allow the vehicle to slow by itself or brake gently if necessary.
· Do not stop on the road if possible. Pull off the road in a safe place and turn on emergency flashers.
· Have the tire changed and replaced.
Power Failure:
If the engine shuts off while you are driving:
· Keep a strong grip on the steering wheel. Be aware that the steering wheel may be difficult to turn, but you can turn it.
· Shift to neutral and look for an escape path. Do not brake hard, brake with steady pressure on the pedal, slow down then pull off the roadway.
· Stop and try to restart the engine; if unsuccessful, raise hood and turn on emergency flashers. Call for help.
