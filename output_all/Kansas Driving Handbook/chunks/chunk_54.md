Driving is one of the most complex tasks that you will do during your lifetime. It is not always easy to be a safe user of the roadway. Driving is a task that involves risk, and it is one of the few things you will do regularly that could injure or kill you. It is well worth the effort to become a better driver and continually improve your driving skills.
Being a safe driver takes a lot of skill, experience, and judgment. Learning to drive and continuing to drive well takes a lot of effort and commitment. Your ability to drive safely depends on the ability to see clearly, not driving while tired, not driving while influenced by alcohol and/or drugs, being generally healthy and being emotionally fit.
Vision
Good vision is critical for safe driving. Your control of the brake, accelerator, and steering wheel is based on what you see. If you cannot see clearly, you will have trouble identifying traffic and roadway conditions, spotting potential trouble, or responding to problems in a timely manner.
Vision is so critical that Kansas requires that a vision test must be passed before you can obtain a license. The vision test measures that you have at least 20/40 vision in at least one eye, with or without corrective lenses. If your vision can be corrected by corrective lenses to meet these requirements, the license issued will be restricted to "corrective lenses" requiring you to wear glasses or contact lenses while you drive a motor vehicle.
Because seeing well is so critical to safe driving, you should have your eyes checked regularly by an eye specialist. You may never know you have poor vision unless your eyes are tested. If you need to wear glasses or contact lenses for driving, remember to:
· Always wear them when driving, even if it is only to drive to a local corner store. If your driver license says corrective lenses are required, it is illegal to move a vehicle without using corrective lenses.
· Keep an extra set of corrective lenses in your vehicle. If your normal corrective lenses are broken or lost, you can use the spare lenses to drive safely.
· Avoid using dark or tinted corrective lenses at night, even if you think they help with glare. Tinted lenses cut down the light that you need to see clearly under night driving conditions.
