## Knowledge Test
The primary purpose of a knowledge test is to make sure you have the information needed to drive safely. The knowledge test only measures a sample of what you know, but it shows you have a basic understanding. The knowledge test consists of 25 multiple choice questions that are important to the safe operation of a motor vehicle, including traffic signs, pavement markings and Kansas laws and driving practices. The questions are based on the information provided in this manual. The test is not timed, but generally takes 15 to 20 minutes to finish. To take the knowledge exam, you may go to any Full-Service Driver License Center, complete an approved driver's education course, or complete the written exam online at https://ks.knowtodrive.com/.
