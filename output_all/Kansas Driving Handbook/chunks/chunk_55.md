## Hearing
Hearing can be helpful to safe driving. The sound of horns, a siren or screeching tires can warn you of danger. A sudden change in the hum of tires on pavement can tell you the road surface or the tires have changed. The sound of your engine tells you if it is working right. As in the case of bad eyesight, hearing problems can come on so slowly that you may not even notice it.
Fatigue
Fatigue is physical or mental tiredness that can be caused by physical or mental strain, repetitive tasks, illness or lack of sleep. Just like alcohol and drugs, it impairs your vision and judgment. Fatigue causes errors related to speed and distance, increases your risk of being in a crash and causes you to take more time to make decisions, which can make you more irritable and make you get upset more easily. When you are fatigued, you could fall asleep behind the wheel and crash, injuring or killing yourself or others.
Before a Trip Do the Following:
路 Get adequate sleep-most adults need 7 to 9 hours to maintain proper alertness during the day
路 Schedule proper breaks-about every 100 miles or 2 hours during long trips
路 Arrange for a travel companion-someone to talk with and share the driving
路 Avoid alcohol and sedating medications-check your labels or ask your doctor
