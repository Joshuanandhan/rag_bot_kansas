## Intersections:
· As you approach an intersection:
· Check traffic thoroughly in all directions. Brake smoothly and evenly and maintain lane position.
· When stopping at an intersection:
" If necessary, come to a complete stop behind any stop signs, signals, sidewalks, or stop lines. If stopping behind another vehicle maintain a safe gap. You should be able to see the rear tires of the vehicle ahead of you.
· When driving through an intersection:
· Check traffic thoroughly in all directions. Keep both hands on the wheel, slow down and yield to any pedestrians or traffic in the intersection. Do not change lanes while proceeding through the intersection.
. Once through the intersection:
· Continue checking mirrors and traffic behind you. Accelerate smoothly. If there are multiple lanes of traffic, accelerate to the speed of traffic, use your turn signal, check your blind spots by looking over your shoulder (head check), check your mirrors and move into the right-most lane when it is safe to do so (if not already there).
