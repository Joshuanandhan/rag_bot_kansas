## Public Transportation
## Transit Buses
· Watch for buses that have stopped. They may block your view of pedestrians about to cross the street, or they may be about to pull into traffic.
· Unlike a school bus, you do not have to stop for a transit bus when they drop off or pick up people, unless you are behind them.
· Look for passengers boarding and exiting the bus that might cross into your path.
· A safety zone is a space set aside for pedestrians boarding, entering, and waiting for trolleys and light rail vehicles. Do not drive through or park on tracks or in a safety zone for any reason. You may pass the zone as soon as it is safe to do so and at no faster than 10 mph.
· When people are boarding or leaving a trolley or light rail vehicle where there is no safety zone, stop behind the nearest door or vehicle platform of the trolley or rail vehicle and wait until the people have reached a safe place.
. Do not overtake and pass on the left of a trolley or light rail vehicle, whether it is moving or standing, except when you are on a one-way street. When the tracks are so close to the right side of the road that you cannot pass on the right, or when a traffic officer directs you, pass on the left.
· Never turn in front of an approaching light rail vehicle or trolley. Let them pass before making your turn.
· Be aware that buildings, trees, and other objects can cause blind spots for the rail vehicle or trolley operator.
· Maintain a safe following distance from the rail vehicle or trolley if it shares the roadway with other users. In many cases you may drive in the same lane as a trolley or light rail vehicle.
