## Crosswalks and Stop Lines:
When required to stop because of a sign or signal, you must stop behind the stop line, crosswalk, or behind the stop sign or signal. Crosswalks define the area where pedestrians may cross the roadway. You must yield to pedestrians entering or in a crosswalk. Not all crosswalks are marked. Be alert for pedestrians when crossing intersections. If crosswalks are not apparent, then you must stop prior to entering the intersection. If there is a stop line before the crosswalk, the stop line must be obeyed first. If you are leaving a driveway, alley or building area, such as a gas station, store, or restaurant it is required that you stop just as you would if there was a stop sign. You should stop behind the sidewalk, and you must yield the right-of-way to all pedestrians and traffic.
The following are some of the most common types of crosswalk markings. Be aware that there are others.
