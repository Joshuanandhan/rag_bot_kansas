## Cell Phones (K.S.A 8-1598)
Anything that distracts from the task of driving makes it more likely that driver will be involved in a traffic crash. Cell phones and other electronic devices can be especially distracting. Kansas law prohibits the use of any electronic device to "write, send, or read" a written communication while driving. This includes texting, email, or any other writing. It does not include GPS devices or weather reports. Talking, or dialing a phone number, on a cell phone is not specifically illegal in Kansas. However, anything that distracts from the task of driving is dangerous.
Just like all other driving skills, containing or managing your anger on the roadway requires training and thought prior to engaging in the driving task. You should realize that responding to another driver's negative behavior can lead to a dangerous situation.
There are things you can do when confronted with aggressive drivers:
路 Get out of their way.
路 Do not challenge them by speeding up or attempting to hold-your-own in your path of travel.
路 Avoid eye contact. Eye contact can sometimes anger an aggressive driver.
路 Ignore gestures and name calling from aggressive drivers and refuse to return them.
