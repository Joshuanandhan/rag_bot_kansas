## Communicating
Crashes often happen because one driver does not see another driver, or when one driver does something the other driver does not expect. It is important that you let other roadway users know where you are and what you plan to do.
Letting Others Know You Are There:
Some drivers do not always pay attention to what is going on around them. It is important to make your vehicle more visible to other roadway users.
Use headlights - Always turn your headlights on to help other roadway users see your vehicle more clearly. If needed, flick your headlights to alert other roadway users your vehicle is there. Many new vehicles are designed with daytime running lights. Remember to turn on your headlights if your vehicle is not equipped with the daylight running system. There are other reasons to use your headlights:
· On rainy, snowy, or foggy days, it is sometimes hard for other drivers to see your vehicle. In these conditions, headlights make your vehicle easier to see. Many states including Kansas require you to turn on your headlights whenever the wipers are used on the vehicle.
· Turn on your headlights when it begins to get dark. Some newer vehicles have automatic sensors for turning on lights. Turning the headlights on a little early will help other drivers to see your vehicle.
· When driving away from a rising or setting sun, turn on your headlights. Drivers coming towards you may have trouble seeing your vehicle. Your headlights will help them see your vehicle.
· Make sure your headlights are clean and working and make sure they are properly adjusted. If they are not adjusted properly, they will not give you a good view, and they can blind other drivers. Have a qualified person make sure they are adjusted properly.
Using your horn - Other roadway users cannot see your vehicle unless they are looking your way. Your vehicle's horn can get their attention. Use it whenever it will help prevent a crash. A light tap on the horn should be all that is needed under normal circumstances. For example, give your horn a light tap:
· When a pedestrian or bicyclist appears to be moving into your lane of travel
· When passing a driver who starts to turn into your lane
· When a driver is not paying attention, or may have trouble seeing you
· When visibility ahead is limited - like a steep hill, a sharp curve or exiting a narrow alley.
If there is danger, do not be afraid to use the horn with a SHARP BLAST. For example:
· When a pedestrian or bicyclist is about to walk, run or ride into the street
· When another vehicle is in danger of hitting you
· When your vehicle is in danger of hitting another roadway user
Not using your horn - A horn should only be used in emergency situations. There are several occasions when you should not use your horn. They include:
· Encouraging someone to drive faster or get out of the way
· Telling other drivers of an error
· Greeting a friend
· When near blind pedestrians
Use emergency signals - If your vehicle breaks down on the highway, you should make sure that other roadway users can see your disabled vehicle. All too often crashes occur because a driver did not see a disabled vehicle until it was too late to stop.
If available, use your cell phone or other device to notify authorities that your vehicle or another vehicle has broken down. Many roadways have signs indicating the telephone number to call in an emergency. If you are having vehicle trouble and must stop:
· Get your vehicle off the road and away from traffic, if possible.
· Turn on your emergency flashers to show your vehicle is disabled.
· Stop where other roadway users have a clear view of your vehicle. Do not stop just over a hill or just around a curve where visibility is limited.
· Try to warn other roadway users that your vehicle is there. Place emergency flares about 200 to 300 feet behind the vehicle, giving other drivers some time to change lanes if necessary.

· Never stand or remain on the roadway and do not try to change a tire in traffic lanes.
· A white cloth attached to a vehicle indicates a disabled vehicle is present, so tie a white cloth to the antenna, side mirror or door handle to signal an emergency. You can also lift the hood to indicate a disabled vehicle
