## Reserved Lanes:
On various roadways, one or more lanes may be reserved for special vehicles. Reserved lanes are marked by special lane marking signs stating that the lane is reserved for special use and often have a white diamond posted at the side of the road or painted on the road surface.
· "Transit" or "bus" means the lane is for bus use only.
· "Bicycle" means the lane is reserved for bicyclists.
· HOV signs or markings mean "High Occupancy Vehicles" and indicate lanes reserved for vehicles with two or more people in them. Signs may indicate how many people must be in the vehicle, as well as the days and hours which apply to the lane use. For example, "HOV 3" means there must be at least three people in the vehicle to use that lane.
