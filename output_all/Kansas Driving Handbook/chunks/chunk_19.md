## Driver's Education
There are many online Driver's Education courses being offered over the internet. Internet courses do not meet requirements for a Driver's License in Kansas. A certificate of completion from an Internet Driver Education course will not be accepted for licensure.
The only programs that are approved by the State of Kansas for Driver Education purposes are programs offered through a local, accredited school districts which have been approved by the Department of Education or approved private driver's education schools offering 8 hours of classroom instruction and 6 hours of behind-the-wheel instruction.
