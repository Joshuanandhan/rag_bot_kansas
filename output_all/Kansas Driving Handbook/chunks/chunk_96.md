## Yellow Lane Markings:
Lines separating traffic moving in opposite directions are yellow. Dashed yellow lines between opposing lanes of traffic mean that you may pass if a safe gap in traffic is available. Some passing zones have signs that tell you where passing is permitted and not permitted by law. Where there is both a solid and a dashed yellow line between opposing lanes of traffic you should not pass if the solid yellow line is on your side. If the dashed line is on your side, you may pass if a safe gap in traffic is available. When you are permitted to pass, you may do so only if the lane entered is clear of traffic flow. Be aware of road conditions and other vehicles. Pass only when necessary. Two solid yellow lines between lanes of traffic means neither side may pass. You may cross a solid yellow line to turn when gaps in traffic flow exist.
