## General Driving:
· Use brakes properly:
· Do not brake harshly. Brake smoothly using steady pressure. Come to a complete stop at traffic signs or signals.
· Proper steering:
· Keep both hands on the outside of the steering wheel at all times unless using other controls. Once you have completed using other controls, return both hands to the steering wheel. All methods of steering are acceptable (i.e., hand-over-hand and hand-to-hand) as long as both hands are on the outside of the wheel.
· Proper lane usage:
· Do not put vehicle over curbs, sidewalks, or lane markings. Complete a turn in the proper lane on a multiple lane road (vehicle should finish a left turn in the left-most lane, the one directly to the right of the centerline). Finish a right turn in the right- most (curb) lane. Move to or remain in the right-most lane unless lane is blocked. Do not attempt lane changes at intersections.
· Regular traffic checks/head checks:
· Check traffic and mirrors regularly. Check traffic and mirrors before, while in and after an intersection, turn or lane change. Watch for hazards by searching left and right at intersections, driveways, store entrances, railroad tracks or any other areas where traffic intersects. Scan and check traffic in high volume areas and areas where pedestrians are expected to be present. Check traffic by looking over your shoulder (head check) when necessary (i.e., lane change, merging).
· Use of turn signals:
· Use turn signals when required. Activate turn signals at appropriate times. Do not signal too early or too late. Cancel turn signals upon completion of a turn or lane change.
· Stopping at stop line or crosswalk or gap:
· When stopping at a stop sign or traffic signal do not stop over marked stop line, pedestrian crosswalk, sidewalk, or other marker, do not stop vehicle in the intersection. When stopping behind another vehicle make sure you can see the rear wheels of the vehicle in front of you.
