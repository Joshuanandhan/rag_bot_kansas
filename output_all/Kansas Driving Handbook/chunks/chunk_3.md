## Getting Started
Are you getting a Kansas driver's license, (DL), learner's permit (LP), or identification card (ID) for the first time or moving to Kansas from another state? Replacing a lost or stolen DL or ID card? Or do you need to renew your current Kansas DL or ID card?
Follow this checklist to ensure your application process goes as smoothly as possible.
If you were previously licensed in Kansas and have moved back, you will be required to present all first- time credential documents.
Document requirements vary, we have included what you need for different situations.
Build a personal list and collect original versions of the documents you will need to present to comply with Kansas' identification requirements. This will make your visit more efficient.
Before you visit the office:
1. Verify you have all the correct documents.
2. Make sure your documents are originals. Faxed, photo-copied, laminated, or electronic copies of documents will not be accepted.
3. Remember, non-U.S. citizens must be processed through the System Alien Verification for Entitlement (SAVE).
4. If you have questions not answered in this document, check https://ksrevenue.gov/dovlicenses.html, email KDOR DL@KS.GOV, or call the Kansas Division of Vehicles' information line at 785-296-3671.
