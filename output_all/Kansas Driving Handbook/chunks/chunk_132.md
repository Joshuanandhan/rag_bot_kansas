## Space for Special Situations
There are certain drivers and other roadway users you should give extra space. These are drivers that may enter your travel path without knowing your vehicle is there. Other roadway users who could have trouble seeing your vehicle include:
· Drivers at intersections or driveways, whose view is blocked by buildings, trees, or other vehicles
· Drivers backing into the roadway or backing into or pulling out of parking spaces
· Drivers whose windows are covered with snow or ice or are steamed-up
· Pedestrians with umbrellas in front of their faces or with their hats pulled down
Distracted roadway users - Even when others can see you, allow extra space or be extra cautious if you think they may be distracted. People who may be distracted include:
· Delivery persons
· Construction workers
· Children or pedestrians who are not paying attention
Confused roadway users - People who are confused may cause an unsafe situation. People who may be confused include:
· Tourists or others, who do not seem to know where they are going
· Drivers who slow down for what seems like no reason
· Drivers looking for street signs or house numbers
Drivers in trouble - If another driver makes a mistake, do not make the situation worse. For instance, when drivers pass you without enough space, reduce your speed and let them return to the lane safely; or if another driver needs to change lanes suddenly, slow down and let them merge. This kind of cooperation will make the roads safer.
Minimizing Hazards
When possible, take potential hazards one at a time. For example, when overtaking a pedestrian who is walking along the roadway or exiting a parked car and an oncoming vehicle is approaching, slow down and let the vehicle pass first so that your vehicle can pass only one roadway user at a time.
