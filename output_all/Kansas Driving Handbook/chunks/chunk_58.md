## These are things you can do to keep from getting distracted:
· Avoid using cell phones. If you need to use your cell phone stop in a safe parking area.
· Avoid arguments and stressful or emotional conversations with passengers that may distract your attention from the road.
· Instead of eating while driving, leave a little early to allow yourself time to stop to eat.
· Be sure children are properly and safely buckled up and give them books, toys or games to occupy their time.
· Properly secure pets in a pet carrier or portable kennel before moving your vehicle.
· Adjust vehicle controls before you begin your trip, take advantage of normal stops to adjust controls or ask your passenger to adjust controls.
· Do not look at something in the distance. Those things are never more important than concentrating on your immediate path of travel.
· Review maps and plan your route before you begin driving. If you need to look at a map while driving, stop in a safe parking area.
· Do not talk with friends in other vehicles or wear headphones to listen to music. These can be deadly when combined with driving.
· Stay focused, pay attention, and expect the unexpected.
· You must maintain your attention to the driving task. You are completely and solely responsible for operating your vehicle in a safe manner. This includes the responsibility for controlling everything that occurs within the vehicle as well. If you are distracted and you experience a crash, the responsibility falls on you, not the distraction.
Aggressive Driving
Aggressive driving occurs when an individual intentionally commits an action or a moving traffic offense, which endangers other persons or property. When drivers are aggressive, they lose control of their emotions and use their vehicle to harm others.
· Some behaviors typically associated with aggressive driving include exceeding the posted speed limit, following too closely, erratic or unsafe lane changes, improperly signaling, failure to obey traffic control devices (stop signs, yield signs, traffic signals, railroad grade cross signals, etc.), rude gestures or language, threatening another driver with a weapon or chasing a vehicle to do harm.
· To prevent yourself from becoming an aggressive driver relax and concentrate on driving. Be sure to drive the posted speed limit, be realistic about your travel time and be courteous and forgiving.
Drive away from the area, if possible and report serious aggressive driving.
Alcohol, Other Drugs and Driving
Alcohol and other impairing drugs are involved in approximately 40% of all fatal crashes. If you drink alcohol or use other impairing drugs and drive, even a little, your chances of being in a collision are much greater than if you did not drink any alcohol or use any other drugs.
