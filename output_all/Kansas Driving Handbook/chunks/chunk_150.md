## Accelerator Failure:
Accelerator failure could be caused by either a broken spring or the pedal getting stuck in the down position. In either case:
· Shift to neutral and search for an escape path.
· Steer smoothly, brake gently and pull off the roadway.
· Turn off vehicle and have the pedal repaired at a service center before driving again.
