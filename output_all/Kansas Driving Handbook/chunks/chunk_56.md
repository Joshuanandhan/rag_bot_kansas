## Ways to Prevent a Fatigue-Related Crash While Driving:
· Watch for the warning signs of fatigue, such as having to turn up the radio or roll down the window to wake yourself up, having trouble keeping your eyes open or drifting from your lane.
· Stop driving-pull off at the next exit, rest area or find a place to sleep for the night.
· Take a nap-find a safe parking area to take a 15 to 20-minute nap.
· Consume caffeine-the equivalent of 2 cups of coffee can increase alertness for several hours. Avoid drinking too much caffeine and keep in mind that it will wear off. Do not rely on caffeine to prevent fatigue.
· Try consuming caffeine before taking a short nap to get the benefits of both.
· Driving at night - Try not to drive late at night between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m.
· The best way to prevent fatigue is sleep.
Driver Distractions
A distraction is anything that takes your attention away from driving. Driver distractions may occur anytime and anywhere. Distracted driving can cause collisions, resulting in injury, death or property damage. Taking your eyes off the road or hands off the steering wheel presents obvious driving risks. Mental activities that take your mind away from driving are just as dangerous. Your eyes can gaze at objects but fail to see them, because your mind is thinking of something else.
