## Adjusting to Traffic Conditions
Vehicles moving in the same direction at the same speed with adequate following distance cannot hit one another. Crashes involving two or more vehicles often happen when drivers move significantly faster or slower than other vehicles on the roadway.
Keeping pace with traffic - If you are going faster than traffic flow patterns, you will have to keep passing other roadway users. Each time you pass one another; there is a chance for a collision. The vehicle being passed on a multiple-lane highway may change lanes suddenly, possibly causing a collision. On a two-way, single-lane roadway, an oncoming vehicle may approach suddenly, possibly causing a collision. Reduce speed and keep pace with other traffic flow traveling within the legal limits. Excessive speed does not save more than a few minutes an hour and often leads to high-risk decision making.
Driving more than 15 mph slower than the traffic flow pattern can be just as dangerous as excessive speed. It tends to make vehicles bunch up behind the slower-moving vehicle and causes the other traffic to take greater risk to pass the slower vehicle. If vehicles are bunched up behind a vehicle, the slow-moving vehicle should pull over when safe to do so and let other vehicles pass.
Entering traffic flow - Search guide signs for the correct route number, direction or destination and check for ramp speed signs. When merging with traffic flow, try to enter at the same speed that other traffic flow is moving. Multiple-lane, limited access roadways generally have acceleration lanes (entrance ramps) to provide time to build-up vehicle speed. Use the acceleration lane to reach the speed of other vehicles before pulling onto the roadway. Do not drive to the end of the acceleration lane and stop. You will not have enough room to get up to the speed of traffic and drivers to the rear will not expect your vehicle to stop, especially if they are watching the traffic flow on the main roadway. If you have to wait for a gap in traffic flow to enter a roadway, slow down on the acceleration lane to wait for a gap. Do not cross the solid white line. Before pulling onto the roadway, check traffic by looking over your shoulder in the direction you plan to move and check your mirrors. When you find a gap, signal, and move carefully into the expressway lane.

Exiting traffic flow - In heavy traffic, it is important to know where you are exiting. Since it is frequently difficult to change lanes, plan to get into the proper lane about one-half mile before the exit. Maintain your
vehicle speed as long as you are on the main roadway. When using a deceleration lane (exit ramp), do not slow down until the vehicle has moved onto the deceleration lane. Use the deceleration lane to reduce speed safely to exit traffic flow. When exiting from a multiple-lane, limited access roadway, check the posted speed for the deceleration lane, look to the rear for traffic flow prior to reducing speed and apply your brake based on the vehicles you are following.

Special conditions - Wherever large numbers of people or traffic gathers, space to maneuver is limited. You need to reduce speed to have time to react in crowded spaces. Some of the times and places where you may need to slow down include:
· Shopping centers, parking lots and downtown areas - These are busy areas with vehicles and people stopping, starting, and moving in different directions.
· Rush Hours - Rush hours often have heavy traffic and drivers that always seem to be in a hurry.
· Narrow bridges and tunnels - Vehicles approaching each other have narrower lanes and are closer together.
· Toll plazas - Vehicles are changing lanes, preparing to stop and then speeding-up again when leaving the plaza. The number of lanes could change both before and after the plaza.
· Schools, playgrounds, and residential streets - These areas often have children present. Always be alert for children crossing the street, running into the street, or riding into the street without looking.
· Highway-railroad grade crossings - You need to make sure that there are no trains coming and that your vehicle has room to cross. Start checking the highway-railroad grade crossing when approaching the round warning sign. Some highway-railroad grade crossings have different levels of rail crossings, so you need to reduce speed to cross safely.
