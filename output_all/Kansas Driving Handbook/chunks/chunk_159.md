## As a bicyclist:
· You are required to ride on the right side of the roadway.
· You must obey all traffic signs and signals and use hand signals to let others know what you plan to do.
· You are allowed to utilize the complete lane if an obstacle and/or hazard presently exist such as: road debris, cracks, parked vehicles or something that may impede your riding path.
· You may use the middle and left side of the roadway if you are going straight through an intersection or making a left-hand turn.
· You are allowed to ride two abreast or two wide in a lane. Doing this creates a tight vehicular density so that cars may pass you more efficiently, as well as help you define your space as a vehicle for surrounding road users.
· There are instances where it could also be beneficial to ride single file; a bicyclist must determine this based on the situation.
· Under the Dead Red Law, if you reach an intersection and the traffic signal will not respond to your bicycle, after waiting what you determine is a reasonable amount of time, you may cross the intersection. This action when performed is done with understanding that the bicyclist will not impede cross-traffic or cause an accident.
· Wear brightly colored clothing and reflectors.
· Use of a headlight at dusk is required, but a taillight is highly recommended to give you further visibility.
· Always keep your bicycle in good repair and use good judgement during any situation to assure the best option is being performed.
