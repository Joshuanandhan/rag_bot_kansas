## Dealing with Skids
Any road that is safe under normal conditions can be dangerous when it is wet or has snow or ice on it. High speeds under normal conditions also increase the possibility of a skid if you must turn or stop suddenly. Skids are caused when you are traveling too fast for conditions, when you stop too suddenly or when the tires can no longer grip the roadway. As you cannot control a vehicle when it is skidding, it is best to avoid a vehicle skid in the first place. If your vehicle begins to lose traction:
路 Visually look for open space - You must pay attention to where your vehicle can go on the roadway. Do not fixate on the hazard you are trying to avoid.
路 Lift off any pedals - Release brake or accelerator pressure to determine if the vehicle is losing traction to the front or rear tires.
路 Recognize traction loss - If the vehicle continues straight while steering, traction is lost to the front tires. If the vehicle is moving sideways without any additional steering input, the rear tires have lost traction.
路 Brake or acceleration response - If the front traction is lost, ease off the brakes to regain traction and reapply the brakes without skidding to continue steering. If the vehicle has ABS, apply the brakes fully to gain steering control to the front tires.
. Steer - If rear traction is lost, turn the steering wheel in the direction of the intended path of travel (the direction you want to go) and continue to steer and counter-steer until the vehicle is traveling straight. Continue to look in the direction you want to go. Avoid looking into the on-coming lane so that your vehicle does not travel across the centerline. If your vehicle is equipped with traction technology, keep steering toward the path of travel to aid the vehicle technology. HSS,
