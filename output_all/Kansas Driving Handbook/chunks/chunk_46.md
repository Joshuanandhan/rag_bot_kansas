## PASSING (K.S.A. 8-1516, 8-1518, 8-1520)
On two-lane roads, with traffic moving in both directions, you may pass traffic on the left if the pass can be completed safely and without exceeding the speed limit. In preparing to pass, check the road ahead for sufficient distance and the road behind for other traffic that may be preparing to pass you. Turn on your left- turn signal before passing. Use your right-turn signal after passing before returning to the right lane. Do not return to the right lane too soon; wait until you can see the entire front of the vehicle you have just passed in your rearview mirror. When your car is being overtaken, stay in your lane and don't increase speed:
· Within 100 feet of a bridge, viaduct, or tunnel if your view is obstructed.
· Within 100 feet of crossing any intersection or railroad grade crossing.
· On a hill, curve, or any other place designated as a no-passing zone.
· Any time the left side of the road is not clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic.
· Where signs prohibit passing.
· Where there is a solid yellow line on your side of the centerline.
· Within 100 feet of an emergency vehicle that is stopped on the side of the roadway and has its emergency lights on.
The "No Passing Zone" is the only pennant-shaped warning sign. It marks the beginning of a no passing zone and is placed on the left side of the road facing the driver.
A double solid yellow line prohibits traffic in both directions from crossing the centerline. You must return to your driving lane before coming within 200 feet of any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction.
