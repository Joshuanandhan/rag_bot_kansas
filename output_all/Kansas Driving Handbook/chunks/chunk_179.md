## As a driver, you should learn and abide by the following safety tips for driving in work zones:
· Watch the traffic around you and be prepared to react by reducing your speed, obeying signs and flaggers and increasing your following distance.
· Do not become oblivious to work zone signs when the work is long term or widespread and be aware that traffic patterns in work zones can change daily including lane shifts or alternating lane closures.
· Merge as soon as possible. Motorists can help maintain traffic flow and posted speeds by moving to the appropriate lane at first notice of an approaching work zone.
· Use extreme caution when driving through a work zone at night whether workers are present or not.
· Adjust your lane position away from the side where workers and equipment are located when possible.
· Some work zones, such as line painting, road patching and mowing are mobile. Just because you do not see the workers immediately after you see the warning sign does not mean they are not out there. Observe the posted signs until you see the one that says, "End Road Work."
· Expect delays, plan for them and leave early to reach your destination on time.
· When you can, avoid work zones altogether by using alternate routes.
Avoiding Collisions with Animals
There may be times when an animal suddenly runs in front of your vehicle. Do not swerve into oncoming traffic or off the roadway to avoid hitting the animal.
Big game animals, mostly deer, are large enough to cause damage to a motor vehicle. The size of the animal may cause you to take drastic action to prevent a collision. This may result in a more serious crash than if the vehicle collided with an animal. Regretfully, the safest alternative may be hitting the animal. Concentrate on retaining control of the vehicle before, during, and after the collision with the animal.
