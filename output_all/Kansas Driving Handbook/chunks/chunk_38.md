State/Provincial/Territory Laws
BASIC SPEED LAW (K.S.A. 8-1557)
Kansas' basic speed law requires that you never drive a vehicle at a speed greater than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions then existing. Consider road, weather, and your vehicle condition, as well as your own physical condition. What might be a reasonable speed at one time may not be reasonable at another time because of differing conditions. Adjust your driving to road, traffic, and weather conditions.
