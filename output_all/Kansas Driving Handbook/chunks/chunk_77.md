## Child Passenger Safety Laws
Using a safety restraint correctly makes a big difference. A child safety seat may not protect a child in a crash if it is not used correctly and installed properly in your vehicle. Check to be sure that all children age 12 and under are properly restrained in the back seat and that a rear-facing child safety seat is never placed in front of an active passenger air bag. Also remember:
· Infants from birth to at least age one, and until they are at least 20 pounds should ride in the back seat in a properly installed, rear-facing infant seat.
· Toddlers over one year old and at least 20 pounds should ride in the back seat in a properly installed, forward-facing child safety seat.
· Children between the ages of 4 and 8, who are no more than 4 feet 9 inches tall, should ride in the back seat in a properly installed booster seat.
· When children outgrow their booster seats, usually at age 8 or when they are 4 feet 9 inches tall, they can use the adult safety belt in the back seat.
· To read your vehicle owner's manual and child restraint directions for more specific information on child restraint systems.
