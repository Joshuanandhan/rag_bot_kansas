## Decision Making
To make appropriate decisions when driving takes a lot of practice and experience. New drivers lack the experience for making appropriate decisions in many situations.
To prepare for the decision-making process it is very important to search actively in the area around your vehicle to identify the various types of road users, their location and their travel path. If you do not identify other roadway users, you cannot begin to make decisions on how to lessen the risk. Good decision making starts with good visual search.
Once you have identified the other roadway users, determine the risks they may pose. Are they moving in the same direction, in the other direction or away from you? Could they collide with your vehicle?
Then decide the course of action that is necessary to lessen the risk. Generally, you are limited to changing your direction (moving left or right), changing your speed (slowing, stopping, or speeding up), or communicating (signaling or sounding your horn). Once you have decided, you will need to take action.
To be a safe driver you must actively search out potential hazards, determine what they might do, decide how to best minimize the hazard, and take action. Practice asking yourself "What If." For example:
· search the area around your vehicle
· identify a potential hazard such as a vehicle pulling out of a driveway or parking lot
· ask yourself, "What If" this driver pulls in front of me
· Decide how to minimize the risk of the driver's actions by either changing direction, changing speed and/or communicating
· then, take action
Practicing asking yourself "What If" can help to make you a better driver and help you to be more prepared for quick decision-making.
