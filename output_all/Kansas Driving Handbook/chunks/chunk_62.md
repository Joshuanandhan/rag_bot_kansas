## Alcohol and the Law
If you are found to have .08 blood alcohol concentration (BAC) or higher, you are in violation of the law. If you are arrested for drinking and driving, the penalties are severe. If you have a BAC of .08 or more, your driver's license and driving privileges may be suspended for 30 days and you may be subject to criminal penalties. In Kansas, if you are under (21), you can also be arrested for alcohol impairment at [.02%]. BAC is the percentage of alcohol in relation to the amount of blood in your body. Even under .08 you are still impaired. Under the law you can still be convicted for driving impaired.

An Alcohol Concentration test measures how much alcohol is in your system and is usually determined by a breath, blood, or urine test. You are required to take a BAC test if asked by a police officer due to Kansas implied consent law (K.S.A. 8-1001). Kansas implied consent law is based on the principle that when you get your Driver's License, you have implicitly consented to a lawfully requested test to determine the alcohol content of the blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substance if suspected of impaired driving. You can lose your Driver's License for one year if you refuse to take a BAC test.
If you are found guilty of an alcohol violation and it is your first conviction, you may be fined from $750 - $1000 plus court costs. You could be sentenced to a minimum of 48 hours in jail or 100 hours of community service and your license will be suspended. You will also be required to drive with an ignition interlock device. For second and subsequent convictions, the penalties are much worse.
