## Types of Steering Methods
There are four methods of steering which can be used when turning at intersections, moving through curves, changing lanes, evasive actions, off-road recovery, operating vehicle controls, parking, turnabouts and backing. When performed properly, each can provide smooth, continuous steering control for specific vehicle control activities.
Hand-to-hand steering - Use hand-to-hand steering, commonly called push/pull steering, when turning the wheel during normal driving activity going forward above 10-15 mph. When using hand-to-hand steering your left hand grasps the wheel between 7 and 8 o'clock and your right hand grasps the wheel between 4 and 5 o'clock. Depending on the direction of the turn, your right or left hand pushes the wheel up and the opposite hand slides up, grasps the wheel, and pulls down to continue the turn. While the pulling hand moves down, the hand that initially pushed up slides back toward its original position to adjust as needed. The driver should use the area on the wheel between 11 and 8 o'clock with the left hand and the area on the wheel between 1 and 8 o'clock with the right hand regardless of the direction of the turn. Simply reverse the hand-to-hand process to bring the vehicle into your intended path.
Since your hands and arms never cross over the steering wheel, there is less chance of injury to the face, hands, and arms in the event of a frontal crash when a vehicle is equipped with a driver side air bag. This is the preferred method of steering, 2 and 10 o'clock is not recommended because it can be dangerous in vehicles equipped with air bags.
Hand-over-hand steering - Use hand-over-hand steering when turning the wheel at low speeds, such as at an intersection or when parking the vehicle. When using hand- over-hand steering, your left hand grasps the steering wheel between 8 and 9 o'clock and your right hand grasps the wheel between 3 and 4 o'clock. Depending on the direction of the turn, use the right top third of the steering wheel to move the wheel to the right and use the left top third of the wheel to move the wheel to the left. This process is repeated as necessary. Simply reverse the hand-over-hand process to bring the vehicle into your intended path.

Evasive action steering - When anti-lock brakes are engaged (if equipped) and steering inputs are required to avoid a hazard, or the vehicle is forced off the roadway, it may be necessary to limit the steering input to avoid moving out of the intended lane of travel and across other lanes of travel. As speeds increase much less steering input is needed to move the vehicle one lane space to the left or right. Modern vehicles only take 45 to 90 degrees of steering to move a vehicle back on the road after an off-road encounter. It is critical to limit the steering to not more than 180 degrees of steering when trying to evade a problem on the roadway. When more than 180 degrees of input is used, traction loss occurs and often the vehicle moves across the roadway in the approach of oncoming vehicles.
One hand steering - Use one hand steering only when backing or operating vehicle controls (wipers, flashers, lights, etc.) that require a temporary reach from the steering wheel. When the driver is required to reach for an operating control, it is important to keep the other hand in the normal vehicle operating position of 8-9 o'clock or 3-4 o'clock, depending on the steering wheel design. The only time that 12 o'clock is recommended is when backing a vehicle to the left or right and the driver must turn in the seat in order to see the path of travel to the rear.
