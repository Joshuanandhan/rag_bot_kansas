## The following right-of-way rules apply at intersections:
· You must yield to pedestrians always. Even if they are jaywalking or crossing the street where they should not be, you must stop for them.
· When crossing a sidewalk to enter or exit a driveway, alley, or parking lot you must yield to pedestrians. It is illegal to drive on a sidewalk except to cross it, such as at a driveway.
· Pedestrians using a guide dog or carrying a white cane must be given the right-of-way always. Do not use your horn as it could confuse or frighten the visually impaired pedestrian or guide dog.
· When turning left you must yield to oncoming vehicles going straight ahead or turning right.
· At an uncontrolled intersection, such as in a residential area, where there is no stop sign, yield sign or traffic signal, you must yield to vehicles in the intersection and those coming from the right.
· At a 4-way stop, the driver reaching the intersection first should be given the right-of-way by other drivers approaching the 4-way stop. If more than one vehicle arrives at the same time, the vehicle on the right goes first.
First Car Rule
Same Time Rule
· When entering a road from a driveway, alley or roadside you must yield to vehicles already on the main road.
· You may not enter an intersection unless you can get through it without blocking traffic flow. Before entering you should wait until traffic ahead clears so that you are not blocking the intersection.
