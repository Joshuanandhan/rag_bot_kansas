The posted speed limit unless otherwise determined by school district policy.
MINIMUM SPEED/IMPEDING THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC (K.S.A. 8-1561)
Minimum speed limits may also be set on some roadways. Where they are posted, any speed below that is considered unlawful under normal weather, road and traffic conditions.
Even when a minimum speed is not posted, it is unlawful to drive a vehicle so slowly as to impede or block the normal movement of traffic. The exception is when it is necessary for safe operation in compliance with the basic speed law.
