## Space to Pass
When passing another vehicle, pass the vehicle as quickly and safely as possible. The longer your vehicle stays alongside the other vehicle, the longer you are in danger of the other vehicle moving toward your lane. To pass:
· Check for oncoming vehicles, vehicles, or other roadway users about to enter the roadway from side streets or driveways or vehicles slowing in the travel path ahead. Check your mirrors and over your shoulder for following or passing vehicles. Signal your intentions when it is safe to pass. Pass from at least two seconds behind the vehicle to be passed to avoid striking the rear side of the vehicle. Steer smoothly into the passing lane. Maintain or adjust speed as necessary. Search the roadway ahead and check mirrors. Do not allow your vehicle to drift toward the vehicle being passed.
· Continue to pass until the complete front of the passed vehicle is visible in your rearview mirror. Signal your intention to return to the lane. Steer smoothly into the lane, maintain or adjust speed as appropriate.

When being passed:
Keep right. Once aware that a vehicle wants to pass, move to the right side of the lane. Maintain a constant speed to allow the driver to pass you.
Whenever signs and/or roadway markings permit passing other vehicles, you will have to determine whether you have enough space to pass in a safe manner. As a rule, only pass one vehicle at a time since it is difficult to determine the amount of time needed to pass, which may be as many as 20 to 30 seconds.

Oncoming vehicles - You must judge whether you will have enough space to pass safely. If you can see an oncoming vehicle, do not attempt to pass. It is difficult to determine the speed of oncoming vehicles, even for experienced drivers. Oncoming vehicles do not seem to be coming as fast as they really are in relation to your vehicle. An oncoming vehicle that is more than 25 seconds from your vehicle generally appears to be standing still. In fact, if you can see the oncoming vehicle closing, it is probably closer than 25 seconds from your vehicle. If unsure about the time and distance, wait to pass until there is enough time and space.
Hills and curves - You must be able to see at least 1/3 of a mile or about 20 to 25 seconds ahead when driving at 55 to 60 mph. Anytime your view is blocked by a curve or a hill, you should assume that there is an oncoming vehicle just out of sight. Therefore, you should treat a curve or a hill as an oncoming vehicle and should not start to pass when within 1/3 of a mile of a hill or curve ahead.
Intersections - It is dangerous and illegal to pass where a vehicle is likely to enter or cross the roadway. These locations often include controlled intersections, uncontrolled intersections and multiple shopping center entrances. Do not pass in intersections and avoid passing at other intersecting points such as parking lot entrances and alleyways.

Lane restrictions - Before passing look ahead for road conditions and traffic that may cause other vehicles to move into your lane position. You may lose your time and space for passing because of:
· People or bicyclists near the roadway
· A narrow bridge or other situation that causes reduced lane width
· A patch of ice, pothole or something on the road.
Space to return - Do not pass unless you have enough space to return to the driving lane. Do not count on other drivers to make space for you.
Highway-railroad grade crossings - You should not pass if there is a railroad grade crossing within the 20 to 25 second area ahead.
