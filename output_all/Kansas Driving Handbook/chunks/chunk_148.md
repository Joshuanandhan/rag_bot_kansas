## Brake Failure:
If your brakes stop working:
· Rapidly pump the brake pedal several times. This will often build up enough brake pressure to allow you to stop.
· If that does not work, use the parking brake. Pull on the parking brake handle if in the center console or push the parking brake foot pedal slowly so you will not lock the rear wheels and cause a skid. Be ready to release the brake if the vehicle does start to skid.
· If that does not work, look for a safe place to slow to a stop. Make sure the vehicle is off the roadway. Do not continue to drive the vehicle without working brakes.
