## Space to the Side
You need space on both sides of your vehicle to communicate properly prior to a turn or a change of lanes.
· Avoid driving next to other vehicles on multi-lane roads. Someone may crowd your lane position, try to change lanes, and pull into your lane space. Increase or reduce your vehicle speed to stay clear of the other vehicle that may be trying to enter your lane space.
· Keep as much space as possible between your vehicle and oncoming vehicles. On a two-way, single lane roadway, do not crowd the center line marking. In general, it is safest to drive in the center of your lane, so your vehicle can move left or right to avoid a potential problem.
· Make space for vehicles entering a multiple-lane, limited access roadway. If there is not a vehicle in the next lane, move over a lane to avoid vehicles entering from the sides.
· Keep extra space between your vehicle and parked cars by moving to the left portion of your lane space without crossing the centerline. Other roadway users could step out from a parked vehicle, from between vehicles, or could pull away from the curb.
· Give extra space to pedestrians or bicyclists, especially children. They can move into the lane space quickly and without warning.
· When a passing vehicle is a tractor-trailer, leave a little more space by moving to the outside portion of your lane space away from the tractor-trailer as it passes.
· Keep in mind that trucks and buses may affect space to your sides.
