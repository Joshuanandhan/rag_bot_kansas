## Using Safety Belts
Before you drive away, always fasten your safety belt and make sure all your passengers are using safety belts or child restraints. Also, remember to lock the vehicle's doors and turn on the childproof locks if children are in the vehicle.
Studies have shown that if you are in a crash while using safety belts, your chances of being hurt or killed are greatly reduced. Safety belts will move with you and lock up if a crash occurs. They keep you from being thrown from the vehicle and against parts inside of your vehicle. In addition to protecting, you from injury as a driver, safety belts help you keep control of the vehicle. If you are struck from the side or make a quick turn, the force could push you sideways, and therefore you cannot steer the vehicle if you are not behind the wheel. In Kansas, it is illegal to drive or to be a front-seat passenger without wearing safety belts. (K.S.A. 8-2503)
Wear a safety belt all the time, not just on long trips or high-speed highways. More than half of the crashes that cause injury or death happen at speeds less than 40 mph and within 25 miles from home.
It is important to wear the safety belt correctly.
Â· A shoulder harness is worn across the shoulder and chest with minimal if any slack. The shoulder harness should not be worn under the arm or behind the back. Wearing the harness, the wrong way could cause serious internal injuries in a crash. See figures below.
