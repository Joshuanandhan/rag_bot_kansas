## When using roundabouts or traffic circles:
· Slow down as you approach the circle. A sign, like the one shown, warns of a roundabout or traffic circle.
· Yield to any traffic in the circle. If another vehicle arrives at the traffic circle at the same time as you do, yield to the vehicle if it is on your right. Also, yield to pedestrians and bicyclists in the traffic circle or roundabout.
· Enter a traffic circle to the right, but steer to the left (in a counterclockwise direction).
