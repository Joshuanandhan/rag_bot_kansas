## The following are tips to help you return to the pavement safely:
· Slowing down will help you return to the roadway without losing control. When your wheels leave the pavement, ease off the accelerator to slow down. Do not brake hard, as this can put your vehicle into a skid and make it difficult to steer. Instead, gently apply the brakes, which will allow you to control steering. Steer straight ahead and slow to 25 mph or less.
· Straddle the pavement edge, which will keep the inside edge of your tires from rubbing. It will also help you to approach the edge at a higher angle, which helps the tire to return to the road surface.
· When there is a gap in traffic from all directions, turn the steering wheel about one quarter-turn to return to the pavement. DO NOT OVERSTEER. When you are back on the pavement, steer back to your lane. If traffic is heavy when you leave the road and the shoulder is wide, drive entirely onto the shoulder and stop. Wait for a large gap in traffic before you reenter. If you cannot get back onto the pavement, pull as far from the road as possible and wait for help.
