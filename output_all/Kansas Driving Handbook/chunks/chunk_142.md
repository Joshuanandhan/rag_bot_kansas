## Braking Quickly
Many newer vehicles have an ABS (Anti-lock Braking System). Be sure to read the vehicle owner's manual on how to use the ABS. The ABS system will allow you to stop without skidding.
With ABS - If you have an anti-lock braking system and you need to stop quickly:
· Press on the brake pedal as hard as you can and keep pressing on it.
· You might feel the brake pedal pushing back when the ABS is working. Do not let-up on the brake pedal. The ABS will only work with the brake pedal pushed down fully.
Without ABS - If you must stop quickly and you do not have an anti-lock braking system:
· You can cause the vehicle to go into a skid if you brake too hard.
· Apply the brakes as hard as you can without locking them.
· If the brakes lock-up, you will feel the vehicle start to skid. Ease up on the brake pedal and then reapply with control. Do not take your foot off the brake pedal.
· As soon as the vehicle stops skidding, push down on the brake pedal again. Keep doing this until the vehicle has stopped.
