## Obeying Appropriate Speed Limits
Speeding is very dangerous; therefore, it is one of the primary causes for crashes. Excessive vehicle speed has severe and often disastrous effects in a crash because speed:
· Reduces your ability to negotiate curves or maneuver around obstacles in the roadway
· Increases the distance a vehicle travels while the driver reacts to a hazard
· Decreases the ability of guardrails and barriers to protect occupants
· Increases tread wear on tires and wear on braking systems
· Increases the risk of crashes because other roadway users and pedestrians may not be able to judge distance accurately
· Increases the level of fatigue for the driver
· Causes the force and impact in a collision to be more severe
Each state has set speed limits for residential roadways, nonresidential roadways, limited access roadways, intersections, and school zones that are in effect when posted speed limits are not in place. You are responsible for knowing the set speed limits for your city or state. Where no special hazard exists the traffic, laws set up speed limits for normal driving conditions. Unless otherwise posted maximum limits are:
In town or cities:
· 30mph in any urban district
On Roads and Highways Outside of Towns:
. 75 mph on any separated multilane highway as designated and posted by the Secretary of Transportation
· 65mph on any State or Federal Highway
· 55mph on any county or township, highway
Speed limit signs are based on traffic congestion, intersections, and roadway conditions, are designed for the safety of all drivers and roadway users and should be followed carefully. You may be cited for traveling too fast for conditions when above the legal limitations. Driving 55 mph in a snowstorm is not recognized as an acceptable speed for a snowy roadway, even if the posted speed limit allows for 55 mph. Remember that speed limits are posted for ideal conditions, so if the roadway is wet or icy, if you cannot see well, or if traffic is heavy, then you must reduce speed to enable your vehicle to stop and steer as needed. Use good judgment to determine the safest speed for the driving conditions.
The best way to avoid speeding is to check your speedometer frequently. You may not be very good at judging how fast you are going without checking the speedometer, so it is easy to be traveling much faster than perceived. This is especially true when switching from high-speed multiple-lane roadways to lower speed single-lane roadways.
