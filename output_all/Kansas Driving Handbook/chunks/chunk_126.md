## Space Ahead
Rear-end crashes are very common at intersections. Drivers following too closely, and then being unable to stop before hitting the vehicle ahead when it stops too quickly, cause these types of crashes. Keep a minimum following distance of two seconds with an additional second for any unusual weather or traffic conditions.
To determine your following distance:
· Watch when the rear of the vehicle ahead passes a sign, pole, or any other stationary point.
· Count the seconds it takes you to reach the same sign, pole, or any other stationary point ("One-thousand- one, one-thousand-two).
· You are following too closely if you pass the stationary point before counting to one-thousand-two.
· Reduce speed and then count again at another stationary point to check the new following interval. Repeat until you are following no closer than "two-seconds."
· After practicing, guess how many seconds away you are from an object and then count the seconds it takes to reach the object to see how accurate you are.
There are certain situations where you would need more space in front of your vehicle. In the following situations, you may need more than a two-second following interval to be safe due to high-risk behavior.
· You need more distance to stop a vehicle on slippery roads, therefore, leave more space in front of your vehicle. If the vehicle ahead suddenly stops, your vehicle will need the extra distance to stop safely.
· Slow down to allow space in front of your vehicle when the vehicle behind wants to pass. Slowing also will allow the pass to be completed in less time.
· Keep more space in front of your vehicle when following motorcycles. Motorcycles are different sizes and have different braking capabilities than other motor vehicles. If the motorcycle should fall, your vehicle needs extra stopping or steering distance to avoid the rider.
· When following drivers whose view to the rear is blocked you should allow for an extra cushion of space so the vehicle can see you. The drivers of trucks, buses, vans, or vehicles pulling campers or trailers may not be able to see your vehicle when you are directly behind them. They could stop suddenly without knowing your vehicle is to the rear. Large vehicles can also block your view of the road ahead; therefore, you should reduce your speed and allow for more space so you can see around the vehicle.
· Add more space in front of your vehicle when carrying a heavy load or pulling a trailer. The extra weight increases your vehicle's stopping time and decreases steering ability.
· Increase your following interval when it is hard to see ahead because of darkness or bad weather.
· If your vehicle is being followed closely, you should allow for extra space. Your vehicle will then be able to stop or steer effectively without being hit from behind.
· Police vehicles, law enforcement, ambulances and fire trucks need more space to operate, so increase your following interval. Many states require other vehicles to stay at least 500 feet to the rear of emergency equipment that is a minimum of 12 seconds at 30 mph and a minimum of 6 seconds at speeds of 60 mph.
· Leave extra space in front of your vehicle for vehicles required to come to a stop at railroad crossings,

· Leave extra space in front of your vehicle when stopped behind another vehicle on a hill or incline. The vehicle ahead may roll back before it begins to move forward.
