Pre-Trip Vehicle Safety Inspection Test:
During the pre-trip inspection, you must show that your vehicle is safe to drive. You may have to walk around the vehicle, point to or touch each item and explain to the examiner what you are checking and why. You will NOT have to open the hood or crawl under the vehicle.
With a parent/guardian or friend, who is properly licensed and over the age of 21, practice inspecting various types of vehicles until you can identify the following vehicle parts and tell your parent/guardian or friend what you are looking for and inspecting. You should be able to state the key features or indicators that show if a vehicle component is safe or unsafe.
External Inspection
· Vehicle Walk Around - Walk around the vehicle, indicating that you are looking at the general condition of the vehicle and that you are looking for children, animals, and other debris around the vehicle before entering. It is critical to walk around the vehicle before driving to be sure the vehicle is in good condition and that there is nothing in the way when you move your vehicle.
· Leaks - Look for puddles or dripping fluids on the ground, under the engine and around the transmission and fuel tank area. It is important to look for leaks because fluid loss could indicate component failure in areas where levels might not be readily checked, such as the transmission or fuel systems.
