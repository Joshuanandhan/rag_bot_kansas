## Parking
You are responsible for making sure that your vehicle is not a hazard when it is parked. A parked vehicle must be in a place that is (1) far enough from any travel lane to avoid interfering with traffic and (2) visible to vehicles approaching from either direction.
· Always park in a designated area as required.
· When parking along the roadway, park your vehicle as far away from traffic as possible. If there is a curb, park as close to it as possible.
