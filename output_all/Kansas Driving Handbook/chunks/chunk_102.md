## General Rules:
When there are no signs or markings to control the use of lanes, there are rules that indicate which lane is to be used. These rules cover general driving, passing and turning.
General Driving - It is illegal and unsafe to back a vehicle in any travel lane except to parallel park. Drivers do not expect a vehicle to be backing towards them and may not realize it until it is too late. If you miss a turn or exit, do not back up. A driver should go on to where it is safe to turn around. Do not stop in travel lanes or on the shoulder for any reason (confusion, breakdown, letting out a passenger). You should keep moving until you can safely pull off the road in a parking area.
When driving on a road with two or more lanes traveling in the same direction, stay in the right lane, except to pass. On a road with three or more lanes traveling in the same direction, use the center travel lane, especially when there is a lot of traffic entering or exiting the traffic flow.
Unless told to do so by law enforcement officials or allowed by [local regulations], never drive on the shoulder of the road.
Passing - On multi-lane roads, the left-most lane is intended to be used for passing slower vehicles. When passing on the right, the other driver may have difficulty seeing you and might suddenly change lanes. Never pass on the shoulder, whether it is paved or not. Other drivers may pull off the road without looking for your vehicle.
Turning - When approaching an intersection, search all corners for traffic controls, pedestrians, other vehicles, etc. and signal your intentions. Where there are no signs or lane markings to control turning, enter and maintain proper position in the lane that is closest to the direction you want to go. Recheck traffic in all directions. Look through the turn to the farthest point possible along the intended path. Turn the steering wheel smoothly as needed. As a safety precaution, turn into the closest lane to you that is going in the direction you want to go. This way, you will cross the fewest lanes of traffic. Accelerate smoothly to appropriate speed, make sure turn signal is cancelled and check traffic to the rear. If you are not already in the right lane after turning, change lanes to the right, when it is safe to do so and maintain lane position.

路 Right turns - On right turns, avoid swinging wide to the left before making the turn. When moving into the other lane, the driver behind you may think you are changing lanes or going to turn left and may try to pass you on the right. Always turn right from the right-most lane or when lane markings indicate multiple lanes can be used for a right turn at the same time.

路 Left turns - When making a left turn and the light turns green, pull into the intersection to be ready to turn. Avoid cutting the corner so sharply that your vehicle is in front of someone approaching from the left. However, be sure to leave room for oncoming vehicles to turn left in front of your vehicle. Always turn left from the left-most lane or when lane markings indicate multiple lanes can be used for a left turn at the same time.
路 Multiple lanes turning - At least one block before turning, identify and enter the lane from which you will turn. Check mirrors for following traffic and check blind spots by looking over your shoulder. Signal and when safe to do so enter appropriate lane. When the green signal appears and it is safe, steer into the lane corresponding to the one from which the turn was made. Maintain lane position and accelerate smoothly to appropriate speed.
路 Turnabouts- There may be times when you find yourself headed in the incorrect direction; for example, if you need to park on the other side of the roadway or you are lost and need to turn around. The safest way to change direction is to turn right and go around the block. This avoids most left turns across traffic. If you are on the interstate system, go to the next exit and turn around. It is illegal to cross the median strip or to use the crossover areas reserved for emergency vehicles.
Two-point Turnabout - In this type of turn a street, alley or driveway is used to reverse the direction you are traveling when it is not practical or possible to drive around a block. Backing onto a street can be dangerous, even when exiting a driveway in a low traffic or in a residential neighborhood. The safest way to perform a two-point turnabout is to back the vehicle into the driveway. This allows you to see traffic better when leaving the driveway. Although backing into a driveway is safer, this type of turn should only be used on a two-lane roadway.
