## Work Zones:
A work zone is an area where roadwork takes place and may involve lane closures, detours and moving equipment. Highway work zones are set up according to the type of road and the work to be done on the road. The work zone can be long or short term and can exist at any time of the year but most commonly in the summer.
Work zones on U.S. highways have become increasingly dangerous places for both workers and drivers. Approximately 40,000 people per year are injured as a result of motor vehicle crashes in work zones. There are a large number of work zones in place across America, therefore, highway agencies are working on not only improving devices used in work zones but also to change the behavior of drivers so crashes can be prevented.
When approaching a work zone watch for materials such as cones, barrels, signs, large vehicles, or workers in bright colored vests to warn you and direct you where to go. All temporary signs in work zones have an orange background and black letters or symbols and tell you what to do, how soon you will encounter the work zone and the speed limit through the work zone. The reduced speed limits are necessary for the safety of the workers and motorists. If there are no reduced speed limit signs, you should obey the normal posted speed limit.
