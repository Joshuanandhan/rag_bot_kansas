Manage the risks by first identifying them and then adjusting your driving techniques to minimize those risks. We know that it is impossible to eliminate the risks so you must learn how to best minimize them.
· Increase time to respond to threats through position and/or speed adjustments
· Increase vehicle control through position and/or speed adjustments
