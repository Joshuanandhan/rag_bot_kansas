## Turns:
· You have been asked to make a turn. As you approach the turn:
· Check traffic in all directions, use the correct turn signal, brake smoothly and evenly and safely get into the correct lane needed for the turn.
· If you must stop before making the turn because of traffic, signals or signs:
· Smoothly come to a complete stop without skidding behind the stop line, crosswalk, or stop sign. A safe gap when stopping behind another vehicle is to stop where you can see the rear tires of the vehicle ahead of you. Keep the front wheels aimed straight ahead.
· When ready to turn:
· Check traffic in all directions. Keep both hands on the steering wheel during the turn. Maintain smooth even acceleration and yield to pedestrians and other traffic. Keep checking your mirror to make sure the vehicle does not hit anything on the inside of the turn. Do not move into oncoming traffic or drive over the curb. Keep the vehicle in the proper lane.
· . After turn:
· Make sure you finish completing the turn in the correct lane and that your turn signal has cancelled. Accelerate to the speed of traffic, use your turn signal, check your blind spots by looking over your shoulder (head check), check your mirrors and move into the right-most lane when it is safe to do so (if not already there).
