## As a pedestrian:
· You are subject to pedestrian traffic laws and have the same responsibilities to obey traffic laws as do motorists.
· You must walk where there is a sidewalk. If there is no sidewalk, you should walk on the left side of the street facing the oncoming traffic.
· At night, you should carry a flashlight; wear light colored clothing and reflective material so motorists can see you easily.
· When you are facing a "WALK" signal or a green light, you have the right-of-way. Make sure all drivers see you and stop for you before crossing the road.
· Do not cross the street when you are facing a "DON'T WALK" signal or a red or yellow light, but If the flashing "DON'T WALK" signal appears when you are crossing the street, you may finish crossing the street.
· You should establish eye contact with drivers who slow down or stop to ensure the driver is yielding the right-of-way to you. Do not assume the driver will stop for you.
Pedestrians are difficult to see, and it is difficult to determine their intentions. As a driver:
· You must yield to pedestrians always. Even if they are not in a crosswalk and crossing the street where they should not be (also known as jaywalking), you must stop for them.
· You must yield when a pedestrian is in a crosswalk. Crosswalks exist at all intersections where a sidewalk meets the street. Not all crosswalks have markings.
· Mid-block crosswalks require you to yield as you would at a corner. Mid-block crossings have warning signs and pavement markings.
· You must always yield the right-of-way to persons who are visually impaired. When a pedestrian is crossing a street guided by a dog or carrying a white cane, you must come to a complete stop.
· Even when you are facing a green light, you must yield the right-of-way to all pedestrians in the intersection. You can only assume right-of-way when your intended path is clear.
· When preparing to make a left turn or U-turn, check for pedestrians in your path even if you have a green arrow.
· As you prepare for a right turn, especially on a red traffic signal, be cautious of pedestrians approaching on your right.
· When approaching a stopped vehicle from behind, slow down and do not pass until you are sure that there are no pedestrians crossing in front of it. This is true even on multi-lane roads.
· Always check for pedestrians in your path before backing, especially in shopping centers or places where there are many pedestrians.
· Be careful in school, playground, and residential areas where children could run out from between parked vehicles. It is a good idea to drive slower than the speed limit in these areas and be prepared to stop quickly.
· In a school zone when lights are flashing or children are present, you must obey a slower speed limit. At a school crossing where there is traffic patrol, stop and yield if you are signaled to do so.
