## Interacting with Commercial Vehicles
Over 250,000 crashes occur between cars and commercial vehicles each year. In more than 70% of all fatal crashes involving cars and commercial vehicles, police report that the car driver contributed to the cause of the crash. Commercial vehicles are very different from cars. Many of these crashes could be avoided by keeping these points in mind:
· Large vehicles are less maneuverable than a car.
· Large vehicles have much larger blind spots than cars even though their drivers sit much higher than vehicle drivers sit.
· Because of their weight, they have longer stopping and accelerating distances and need more room to turn.
