Work Zone Signs - These construction, maintenance, or emergency operation signs alert you to work zones ahead and warn you that people are working on or near the roadway. They are generally diamond or rectangular shaped and orange with black letters or symbols. These warnings include workers ahead, reduced speed, detours, slow moving construction equipment and poor or suddenly changing road surfaces.

Active Work Zone
In work zones, traffic may be controlled by a person with a sign or flag to tell you which direction to travel, to slow down or stop. You must follow their instructions.
Barriers, such as drums, cones, and tubes (panels) are used to keep traffic out of hazardous work zones. Along with signs and road markings, they guide you safely through the work zone. Barriers may be used to keep drivers from entering closed roads or other areas where it is dangerous to drive. Temporary traffic signals may be used in work zones. You may see a warning sign showing a symbol of a traffic signal. Stop at the white line, if present.

Give construction workers a "brake." Reduce your speed in work zones and be prepared to stop suddenly. Do not tailgate in work zones. [Fines for speeding in a work zone are doubled.]
Regulatory Signs - These signs tell you about specific laws that you must obey, such as rules for traffic direction, lane use, turning, speed, parking, and other special situations. These signs are square, rectangular, or have a special shape and are white with black, red or green letters or symbols.
Some regulatory signs have a red circle with a red slash over a symbol. These signs prohibit certain actions.
No Left Turn
No Right Turn
No U-Turn
Common types of regulatory signs are:
SPEED LIMIT 65
MINIMUM SPEED 40
Speed Limit Signs - These black and white signs indicate the maximum legal speed allowed or the minimum legal speed required. The maximum limit should be driven only in ideal driving conditions, and you must reduce your speed when weather or traffic conditions require it. For example, you should reduce your speed when the roadway is slippery, during rain, snow, icy conditions, foggy conditions, and anytime it is difficult to see the roadway clearly. Some high-speed roads have minimum speed limits, and you are legally required to travel at least this fast so as not to be a hazard to other drivers.
![SCHOOL SPEED 20 WHIEN FLASHING]()
School Speed Limit When Flashing Sign - This sign is posted before a school to indicate a reduced speed limit in a school zone. The speed limit is required only when flashing; otherwise obey the roadway's speed limit.
Lane Use Control Signs - These black and white signs tell you where you can go, where you can turn and often use an arrow symbol. These signs can be located on the side of the road or hanging over the lane of travel. Sometimes arrows may be painted on the road as a supplement to the signs.
![Straight Left Turn Only Right Turn Only Straight or Turn Right]()
![STOP]()
Stop Sign - A stop sign has eight sides and is red with white letters. You must stop behind the stop line or crosswalk if one is present. Look for crossing vehicles and pedestrians in all directions and yield the right-of-way. When it is safe to do so, you may enter the intersection. A 4-WAY sign may be added to the stop sign at intersections where all approaching traffic has a stop sign. You may also see 3- WAY, 5-WAY or ALL-WAY signs.
![4-WAY]()
![YIELD]()
Yield Sign - A yield sign is a red and white downward pointing triangle with red letters. It means you must slow down and allow traffic that has the right-of-way to cross before entering.
![CENTER LANE ONLY]()
Shared Center Lane Left Turn Only - This sign tells you where a lane is reserved for the use of left turning vehicles from either direction and is not to be used for through traffic or passing other vehicles.
