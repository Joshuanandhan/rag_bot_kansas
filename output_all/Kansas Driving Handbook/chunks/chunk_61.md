## Alcohol:
Never let a friend or relative drive if they have been drinking. If a friend or relative has been drinking:
路 Take their keys away
路 Arrange for a driver who has not been drinking
路 Call a cab
路 Have them stay overnight
There is no way to get all the alcohol or other drugs out of the circulatory system to become sober quickly. Coffee, fresh air, cold showers or eating will not help to remove the alcohol or other drug combination from the circulatory system. Time is the only medically proven method to remove alcohol or other drug combinations from the circulatory system. It takes about an hour for the body to get rid of one normal drink from the circulatory system. Therefore, if someone has had four normal drinks, they should wait four hours or more before they drive. Keep in mind that sober means that no alcohol or other impairing drugs are in the circulatory system of the body.
The best advice is not to drive a vehicle of any kind if alcohol or other drugs are consumed. Impairment starts with the first drink. Even one drink of alcohol can affect a person's ability to operate a motor vehicle. With one or more drinks in the bloodstream a person is visibly impaired and could be arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
