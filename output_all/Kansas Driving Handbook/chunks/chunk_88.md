## Traffic Control Devices
Traffic control devices include traffic signals, signs, and pavement markings. Traffic control also can be provided by law enforcement, highway personnel or school crossing guards. You must obey directions from these persons.
Traffic Signals
Traffic signals are lights that tell you when or where you should stop and go. Traffic lights are usually at intersections and are red, yellow, and green from top to bottom, when on the same signal. There are some intersections and other locations where there are single green, yellow, or red lights. In some metropolitan areas, traffic lights are horizontal, instead of vertical, where the red light is on the left, the yellow light is in the middle and the green light is on the right.
Steady GREEN Traffic Light - This means you can go through the intersection if it is clear to do so. You must yield to emergency vehicles and other roadway users as required by law. If you are stopped at the intersection and the light turns green, you must allow crossing traffic to clear the intersection before you go ahead. Turning left at a steady green traffic light means you may turn but only when the intersection is clear to do so. You should always yield to the oncoming traffic flow and pedestrians.
GREEN Arrow - This means you can safely turn in the direction of the arrow, if the intersection is clear of other roadway users. When the arrow is green, oncoming or crossing traffic should yield to your turning action but be careful of others making a right turn on red from the other side of the intersection. Be alert for signs that prohibit turns at intersections. When turning at intersections always watch for pedestrians crossing in front or from the side of your vehicle.
Steady YELLOW Traffic Light - This means the traffic light is about to change to red. You should slow down and come to a complete stop if traffic flow to the rear allows. If you are already in the intersection when the yellow light comes on, you may continue safely through the intersection.
Flashing YELLOW Traffic Light - This means slow down and proceed with caution. You should be prepared to stop for any traffic flow that may be entering the intersection.
YELLOW Arrow - This means that the green arrow is ending; you should prepare to stop and yield the right- of-way to oncoming traffic or pedestrians.
Steady RED Traffic Light - This means stop prior to entering the intersection. You must wait behind the stop line, crosswalk, or intersection until the traffic light turns green. In some locations, there may be a small, very bright blinking light in the middle of the red light. This device is to alert you of the red light and that you must stop. When turning right at an intersection, if there is no sign prohibiting a right turn on a red light, you may turn after stopping and checking for traffic and pedestrians. Some left turns may be permitted on red when moving from a one-way street onto another one-way street or from a two-way street onto a one-way street. You must check for traffic and pedestrians crossing in front or to the side of your vehicle when turning left on red, where permitted.
Flashing RED Traffic Light - This means you must stop behind a stop line, crosswalk, or intersection before entering and use the same procedure as you would at a stop sign, by coming to a complete stop, looking both ways before entering the intersection and yielding right-of-way.
RED Arrow - This means you must stop, and you may not go in the direction of the arrow until the green arrow or light returns on the signal.
Traffic Signs
Traffic signs tell you about traffic rules, hazards, roadway location, roadway directions and the location of roadway services. The shape, color, symbols, and words of these signs give clues to the type of information they provide.
Warning Signs - These signs tell a driver of possible danger that might be ahead, such as warning you to slow down and be prepared to stop if necessary, or a hazard or special situation on the roadway that is ahead. These signs are usually yellow with black lettering or symbols and are diamond shaped. Some warning signs may be fluorescent yellow, such as school zones, school crossing and pedestrian crossing. Some common warning signs are shown.
