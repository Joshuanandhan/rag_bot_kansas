## Driver Awareness
Almost all activities people engage in have some level of risk. Operating a motor vehicle is a risky activity and drivers must do all they can to reduce risk. Consider the following steps to manage risk and be a safe and responsible driver:
Accept the responsibilities associated with operating a motor vehicle:
· Having a Driver's License is a privilege, not a right. You must have a Driver's License to operate a vehicle of any kind on a public highway or parking facility.
· Other drivers and pedestrians will expect you to follow the laws and rules of the road.
· Do not drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol or otherwise be impaired while driving.
· You and your passenger(s) should always wear seatbelts.
· If you are a minor, you and your parent(s) or guardian(s) will be responsible for the financial consequences of your driving. If you have a Driver's License, they will expect you to drive safely and responsibly.
· Passengers in your vehicle have put their safety in your hands and expect that because you have a Driver's License, you will drive safely.
· A vehicle can cause extensive property damage, injury and death and should be handled with the caution you would show any dangerous weapon.
· Driving safely includes where you park your vehicle. You are responsible for where you park your vehicle and that it will not roll away, such as on a hill. Make sure that you do not impede traffic or pedestrians.
· Although it may not seem important to obey everyday laws, it is important to do so for the safety of yourself and others.
· Safely sharing the roadway with other drivers and pedestrians is essential for avoiding crashes.
· The traffic laws and rules of the road cannot address all possible driving situations. If you remember to be courteous, you can help avoid crashes and keep traffic moving in an orderly fashion.
· The golden rule of driving is to treat others the way you would want to be treated. You should obey traffic laws, drive responsibly, and avoid taking unnecessary risks.
