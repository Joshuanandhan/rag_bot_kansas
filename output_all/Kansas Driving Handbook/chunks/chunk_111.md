## Parallel Parking:
· Entering a Parallel Parking Space - Identify the space in which you will park and check traffic. Turn on the appropriate turn signal. If there is traffic coming from behind, stop parallel to the vehicle you are going to park behind and allow following vehicles to pass before parking. Once traffic is clear, shift to reverse and look to the rear in the direction the vehicle will be moving. Back slowly while turning the steering wheel rapidly in the appropriate direction. Continue backing until your front bumper is in line with the rear bumper of the vehicle you are parking behind. Back slowly while turning the steering wheel rapidly to center the vehicle into the space. Stop before touching the bumper of the vehicle to the rear. Shift to drive and adjust the vehicle in the parking space.

· Exiting a Parallel Parking Space - When exiting the parking space start the engine, check traffic in all directions, place your foot on the brake, shift to reverse and back as much as possible to the vehicle parked behind you. Check for traffic and signal. Shift to drive and move forward slowly, steering into the lane of traffic. Check to make certain that the front bumper of the vehicle will clear the vehicle ahead. Straighten wheels and move forward into the appropriate lane of traffic when the door post of the vehicle clears the rear bumper of the vehicle parked ahead of you.
· No-Parking Zones - There are many areas where you cannot park. Check for signs that may prohibit or limit parking. Some parking restrictions are indicated by colored curb markings.
