## To perform a three-point turnabout:
· Check the mirrors and activate your right turn signal to communicate your intention to pull off to the right side of the road. Stop on the right side of the road.
· Activate your left turn signal, check traffic, and check blind spot by looking over your left shoulder. When traffic is clear, turn hard left to the other side of the road and stop once you have reached the other side.
· Place the vehicle in reverse, check traffic and check blind spots to both sides by looking over your shoulder. When traffic is clear, turn hard right to the other side of the road and stop.
· Place the vehicle in drive, activate the left turn signal, and check traffic and blind spots. When traffic is clear, turn hard left and drive forward into the right lane of traffic heading in the new direction. Check traffic and make sure your turn signal has cancelled. Continue driving straight in the new direction of travel.

U-Turns - These turns require wide streets or vehicles that can turn in a very small area. U-turns are not legal in all places, so watch out for signs that prohibit them. If you must make a U-turn, move as far to the right as you can. Wait for a large gap in the traffic in both directions then turn the wheel left sharply, ending up in the opposite lane, and adjust your speed to match the traffic flow. Watch for other vehicles turning right into your intended path

Roundabouts and Traffic Circles - These are found in some areas to help ensure safe passage of traffic through an intersection without necessarily stopping the flow of traffic. A roundabout or traffic circle is a circular intersection with design features that promote safe and efficient traffic flow. Vehicles travel counterclockwise around a raised center island, with entering traffic yielding the right-of-way to circulating traffic. When entering the roundabout or traffic circle you must negotiate a sharp curve. Slow your speed to about 15 to 20 mph. Once in the roundabout, proceed to the appropriate exit, following the guidance provided by traffic signs and pavement markings. If there is more than one lane going in the same direction, make sure you know where you want to go and are in the proper lane before entering and do not change lanes or pass any vehicles.
