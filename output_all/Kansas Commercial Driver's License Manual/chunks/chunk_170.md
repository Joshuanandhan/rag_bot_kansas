## 3.3.4 - Covering Cargo
There are two basic reasons for covering cargo:
1. To protect people from spilled cargo.
2. To protect the cargo from weather.
Spill protection is a safety requirement in many states. Be familiar with the laws in the states you drive in.
You should look at your cargo covers in the mirrors from time to time while driving. A flapping cover can tear loose, uncovering the cargo, and possibly block your view or someone else's.
