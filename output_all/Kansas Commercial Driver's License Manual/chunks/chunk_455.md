SHARE YOUR LIFE. BECOME AN ORGAN AND TISSUE DONOR
Are you aware that thousands of people in the United States are waiting for a life-saving organ transplant? Thousands more can benefit from a skin, bone, tendon, cornea or other tissue transplant. Currently, there is a very serious need for organ and tissue donation-especially in the minority community.
When applying for or renewing your driver's license, you will be asked if you would like to be an organ and tissue donor. By saying yes, the word "Donor" will be placed on the front of your license. You will also be asked if you want to be listed on the Donor Registry. Both options serve as an indication of your intent and commitment to become a donor. In the event of your death, this information will help your family know what your wishes are.
Kansas law allows any person who is 18 years or older to become an organ and tissue donor after their death by indicating their wishes on the back of their driver's license and having it signed by witnesses. When properly signed, the driver's license or donor card becomes a legal document and must be honored after death. A person who is under age 18 can sign the license and be listed on the registry with the approval/signature of their parent/s or guardian.
Effective July 1, 2010, House Bill 2486 designated the Kansas statewide organ and tissue donor registry as First-Person Consent. The change to first-person consent means that an individual's decision to donate (also referred to as authorization) is legally binding, and no one else may reverse that decision if the individual is at least 18 years old.
DID YOU KNOW?
· People of all ages and medical histories are considered for potential donation. Your medical condition at the time of death will determine what organs and tissue can be donated.
· All major religions approve of organ and tissue donation and consider donation the greatest gift.
· An open casket funeral is possible for organ and tissue donors.
· There is no cost to the donor's family or estate for organ and tissue donation. Funeral costs remain the responsibility of the family.
· Living donation is possible.
