## 9.3.8 - Recognizing Hazardous Materials
Learn to recognize shipments of hazardous materials. To find out if the shipment includes hazardous materials, look at the shipping paper. Does it have:
An entry with a proper shipping name, hazard class, and identification number? A highlighted entry, or one with an X or RQ in the hazardous materials column? Other clues suggesting hazardous materials:
What business is the shipper in? Paint dealer? Chemical supply? Scientific supply house? Pest control or agricultural supplier? Explosives, munitions, or fireworks dealer?
Are there tanks with diamond labels or placards on the premises?
What type of package is being shipped? Cylinders and drums are often used for hazardous materials shipments.
Is a hazard class label, proper shipping name, or identification number on the package? Are there any handling precautions?
