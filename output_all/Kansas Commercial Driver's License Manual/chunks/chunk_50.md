## Steering System Defects
· Missing nuts, bolts, cotter keys, or other parts.
· Bent, loose, or broken parts, such as steering column, steering gear box, or tie rods.
· If power steering equipped, check hoses, pumps, and fluid level; check for leaks.
· Steering wheel play of more than 10 degrees (approximately 2 inches movement at the rim of a 20-inch steering wheel) can make it hard to steer.

Suspension System Defects. The suspension system holds up the vehicle and its load. It keeps the axles in place. Therefore, broken suspension parts can be extremely dangerous. Look for: Spring hangers that allow movement of axle from proper position. See Figure 2.2.

Cracked or broken spring hangers.
Missing or broken leaves in any leaf spring. If one-fourth or more are missing, it will put the vehicle "out of service", but any defect could be dangerous. See Figure 2.3

Torque rod or arm, u-bolts, spring hangers, or other axle positioning parts that are cracked, damaged, or missing.

Any loose, cracked, broken, or missing frame members.
Exhaust System Defects. A broken exhaust system can let poison fumes into the cab or sleeper berth. Look for:
· Loose, broken, or missing exhaust pipes, mufflers, tailpipes, or vertical stacks.
· Loose, broken, or missing mounting brackets, clamps, bolts, or nuts.
· Exhaust system parts rubbing against fuel system parts, tires, or other moving parts of vehicle.
· Exhaust system parts that are leaking.
Emergency Equipment. Vehicles must be equipped with emergency equipment. Look for: Fire extinguisher(s).
Spare electrical fuses (unless equipped with circuit breakers).
Warning devices for parked vehicles: three reflective triangles or at least 6 fusees or 3 liquid burning flares).
Cargo (Trucks). You must make sure the truck is not overloaded and the cargo is balanced and secured before each trip. If the cargo contains hazardous materials, you must inspect for proper papers and placarding.
