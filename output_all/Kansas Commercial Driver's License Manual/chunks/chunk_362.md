## 10.1.4 - Outside Left and Right Side Convex Mirrors
The convex mirrors are located below the outside flat mirrors. They are used to monitor the left and right sides at a wide angle. They provide a view of traffic, clearances, and students at the side of the bus. These mirrors present a view of people and objects that does not accurately reflect their size and distance from the bus.
You should position these mirrors to see: The entire side of the bus up to the mirror mounts. Front of the rear tires touching the ground. At least one traffic lane on either side of the bus.
Figure 10.3 shows how both the outside left and right side convex mirrors should be adjusted.
10.1.5 - Outside Left and Right Side Crossover Mirrors
These mirrors are mounted on both left and right front corners of the bus. They are used to see the front bumper "danger zone" area directly in front of the bus that is not visible by direct vision, and to view the "danger zone" area to the left side and the right side of the bus, including the service door and front wheel area. The mirror presents a view of people and objects that does not accurately reflect their size and distance from the bus. The driver must ensure that these mirrors are properly adjusted.

Ensure that the mirrors are properly adjusted so you can see:
路 The entire area in front of the bus from the front bumper at ground level to a point where direct vision is possible. Direct vision and mirror view vision should overlap.
路 The right and left front tires touching the ground.
路 The area from the front of the bus to the service door.
路 These mirrors, along with the convex and flat mirrors, should be viewed in a logical sequence to ensure that a child or object is not in any of the danger zones.
_Figure 10.4 illustrates how the left and right side crossover mirrors should be adjusted._
