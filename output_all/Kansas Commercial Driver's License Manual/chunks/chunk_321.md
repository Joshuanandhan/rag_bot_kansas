Column 3 shows a material's hazard class or division, or the entry "Forbidden." Never transport a "Forbidden" material. Placard hazardous materials shipments based on the quantity and hazard class. You can decide which placards to use if you know these three things:
1. Material's hazard class.
2. Amount being shipped.
3. Amount of all hazardous materials of all classes on your vehicle.
Column 4 lists the identification number for each proper shipping name. Identification numbers are preceded by the letters "UN", "NA." or "ID". The letters "NA" are associated with proper shipping names that are only used within the United States and to and from Canada. The letters "ID" are associated with proper shipping names recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (IACO) Technical instructions for transportation by air. The identification number must appear on the shipping paper as part of the shipping description and also appear on the package. It also must appear on cargo tanks and other bulk packaging. Police and firefighters use this number to quickly identify the hazardous materials.
Column 5 shows the packing group (in Roman numeral) assigned to a material.
Column 6 shows the hazard warning label(s) shippers must put on packages of hazardous materials. Some products require use of more than one label due to a multiple hazard being present.
Column 7 lists the additional (special) provisions that apply to this material. When there is an entry in this column, you must refer to the federal regulations for specific information. The numbers 1-6 in this column mean the hazardous material is a poison inhalation hazard (PIH). PIH materials have special requirements for shipping papers, marking, and placards.
Column 8 is a three-part column showing the section numbers covering the packaging requirements for each hazardous material.
Note: Columns 9 and 10 do not apply to transportation by highway.
Appendix A to 49 CFR 172.101 - The List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities. The DOT and the EPA want to know about spills of hazardous substances. They are named in the List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities. See Figure 9.5. Column 2 of the list shows each product's reportable quantity (RQ). When these materials are being transported in a reportable quantity or greater in one package, the shipper displays the letters RQ on the shipping paper and package. The letters RQ may appear before or after the basic description. You or your employer must report any spill of these materials, which occurs in a reportable quantity.
If the words INHALATION HAZARD appear on the shipping paper or package, the rules require display of the POISON INHALATION HAZARD or POISON GAS placards, as appropriate. These placards must be used in addition to other placards, which may be required by the product's hazard class. Always display the hazard class placard and the POISON INHALATION HAZARD placard, even for small amounts.
Appendix B to 49 CFR 172.101 - List of Marine Pollutants Appendix B is a listing of chemicals that are toxic to marine life. For highway transportation, this list is only used for chemicals in a container with a capacity of 119 gallons or more without a placard or label as specified by the HMR.
Any bulk packages of a Marine Pollutant must display the Marine Pollutant marking (white triangle with a fish and an "X" through the fish). This marking (it is not a placard) must also be displayed on the outside of the vehicle. In addition, a notation must be made on the shipping papers near the description of the material: "Marine Pollutant".
