## 7.1 - Pulling Double/Triple Trailers
Take special care when pulling two and three trailers. There are more things that can go wrong, and doubles/triples are less stable than other commercial vehicles. Some areas of concern are discussed below.
7.1.1 - Prevent Trailer from Rolling Over
To prevent trailers from rolling over, you must steer gently and go slowly around corners, on ramps, off ramps, and curves. A safe speed on a curve for a straight truck or a single trailer combination vehicle may be too fast for a set of doubles or triples.
7.1.2 - Beware of the Crack-the-whip Effect
Doubles and triples are more likely to turn over than other combination vehicles because of the "crack- the-whip" effect. You must steer gently when pulling trailers. The last trailer in a combination is most likely to turn over. If you don't understand the crack-the-whip effect, study subsection 6.1.2 of this manual.
7.1.3 - Inspect Completely
There are more critical parts to check when you have two or three trailers. Check them all. Follow the procedures described later in this section.
7.1.4 - Look Far Ahead
Doubles and triples must be driven very smoothly to avoid rollover or jackknife. Therefore, look far ahead so you can slow down or change lanes gradually when necessary.
7.1.5 - Manage Space
Doubles and triples take up more space than other commercial vehicles. They are not only longer, but also need more space because they can't be turned or stopped suddenly. Allow more following distance. Make sure you have large enough gaps before entering or crossing traffic. Be certain you are clear at the sides before changing lanes.
