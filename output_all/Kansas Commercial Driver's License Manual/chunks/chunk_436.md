路 Complete the test without an accident or moving violation.
During the driving test, the examiner will be scoring you on specific driving maneuvers as well as on your general driving behavior. You will follow the directions of the examiner. Directions will be given to you
so you will have plenty of time to do what the examiner has asked. You will not be asked to drive in an unsafe manner.
If your test route does not have certain traffic situations, you may be asked to simulate a traffic situation. You will do this by telling the examiner what you are or would be doing if you were in that traffic situation.
