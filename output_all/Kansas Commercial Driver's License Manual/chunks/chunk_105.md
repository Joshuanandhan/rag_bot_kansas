## 2.9.1 - The Distracted Driving Crash Problem
The Large Truck Crash Causation Study (LTCCS) reported that 8 percent of large-truck crashes occurred when Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) drivers were externally distracted, and 2 percent of large truck crashes occurred when the driver was internally distracted.
Approximately 5,500 people are killed each year on U.S. roadways and an estimated 448,000 are injured in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted driving (NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts: Distracted Driving). Research indicates that the burden of talking on a cell phone - even if it's hands-free - saps the brain of 39% of the energy it would ordinarily devote to safe driving. Drivers who use a hand-held device are more likely to get into a crash serious enough to cause injury. (NHTSA distracted driving website, www.distraction.gov).
