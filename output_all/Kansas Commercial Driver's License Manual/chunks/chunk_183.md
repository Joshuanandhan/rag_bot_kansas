## 4.1.4 - Roof Hatches
You may lock some emergency roof hatches in a partly open position for fresh air. Do not leave them open as a regular practice. Keep in mind the bus's higher clearance while driving with them open.
4.1.5 - Use Your Seatbelt!
The driver's seat should have a seat belt. Always use it for safety.
