## 2.9.6 - Don't Drive Distracted
Your goal should be to eliminate all in-vehicle distractions before driving begins. Accomplishing this goal can be done by:
· Assessing all potential in-vehicle distractions before driving
· Developing a preventative plan to reduce/eliminate possible distractions
· Expecting distractions to occur
· Discussing possible scenarios before getting behind the wheel
· Based on the assessment of potential distractions, you can formulate a preventative plan to reduce/eliminate possible distractions.
· If drivers react a half-second slower because of distractions, crashes double. Some tips to follow so you won't become distracted:
· Turn off all communication devices.
· If you must use a mobile phone, make sure it is within close proximity, that it is operable while you are restrained, use an earpiece or the speaker phone function, use voice-activated dialing; or use the hands-free feature. Drivers are not in compliance if they unsafely reach for a mobile phone, even if they intend to use the hands-free function.
· Do not type or read a text message on a mobile device while driving.
· Familiarize yourself with your vehicle's features and equipment before you get behind the wheel.
· Adjust all vehicle controls and mirrors to your preferences prior to driving.
· Pre-program radio stations and pre-load your favorite CDs.
· Clear the vehicle of any unnecessary objects and secure cargo.
· Review maps, program the GPS and plan your route before you begin driving.
· Don't attempt to read or write while you drive.
· Avoid smoking, eating, and drinking while you drive. Leave early to allow yourself time to stop to eat.
· Don't engage in complex or emotionally intense conversations with other occupants.
· Secure commitment from other occupants to behave responsibly and to support the driver in reducing distractions.
