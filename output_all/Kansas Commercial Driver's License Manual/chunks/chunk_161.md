## Section 3 -Transporting Cargo Safely
This Section Covers
· Inspecting Cargo
· Cargo Weight and Balance
· Securing Cargo
· Cargo Needing Special Attention
This section tells you about hauling cargo safely. You must understand basic cargo safety rules to get a CDL.
If you load cargo wrong or do not secure it, it can be a danger to others and yourself. Loose cargo that falls off a vehicle can cause traffic problems and others could be hurt or killed. Loose cargo could hurt or kill you during a quick stop or crash. Your vehicle could be damaged by an overload. Steering could be affected by how a vehicle is loaded, making it more difficult to control the vehicle.
Whether or not you load and secure the cargo yourself, you are responsible for:
· Inspecting your cargo.
· Recognizing overloads and poorly balanced weight.
. Knowing your cargo is properly secured and does not obscure your view ahead or to the sides.
· Knowing your cargo does not restrict your access to emergency equipment.
If you intend to carry hazardous material that requires placards on your vehicle, you will also need to have a hazardous materials endorsement. Section 9 of this manual has the information you need to pass the hazardous materials test.
