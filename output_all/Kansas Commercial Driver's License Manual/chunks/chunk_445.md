## 13.1.8 - Railroad Crossing
Before reaching the crossing, all commercial drivers should:
· Decelerate, brake smoothly, and shift gears as necessary.
· Look and listen for the presence of trains.
· Check traffic in all directions.
Do not stop, change gears, pass another vehicle, or change lanes while any part of your vehicle is in the crossing.
If you are driving a bus, a school bus, or a vehicle displaying placards, you should be prepared to observe the following procedures at every railroad crossing (unless the crossing is exempt):
· As the vehicle approaches a railroad crossing, activate the four-way flashers.
· Stop the vehicle within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail.
· Listen and look in both directions along the track for an approaching train and for signals indicating the approach of a train. If operating a bus, you may also be required to open the window and door prior to crossing tracks.
· Keep hands on the steering wheel as the vehicle crosses the tracks.
· Do not stop, change gears, or change lanes while any part of your vehicle is proceeding across the tracks.
· Four-way flashers should be deactivated after the vehicle crosses the tracks.
· Continue to check mirrors and traffic.
Not all driving road test routes will have a railroad crossing. You may be asked to explain and demonstrate the proper railroad crossing procedures to the examiner at a simulated location.
