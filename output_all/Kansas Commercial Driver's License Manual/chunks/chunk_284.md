## Uncouple Converter Dolly
1. Lower dolly landing gear.
2. Disconnect safety chains.
3. Apply converter gear spring brakes or chock wheels.
4. Release pintle hook on first semi-trailer.
5. Slowly pull clear of dolly.
Never unlock the pintle hook with the dolly still under the rear trailer. The dolly tow bar may fly up, possibly causing injury, and making it very difficult to re-couple.
