## 10.6 - Antilock Braking Systems
## 10.6.1 - Vehicles Required to Have Antilock Braking Systems
The Department of Transportation requires that antilock braking systems be on:
· Air brakes vehicles, (trucks, buses, trailers and converter dollies) built on or after March 1, 1998.
· Hydraulically braked trucks and buses with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 lbs or more built on or after March 1, 1999.
Many buses built before these dates have been voluntarily equipped with ABS. Your school bus will have a yellow ABS malfunction lamp on the instrument panel if it is equipped with ABS.
