## 2.20 - Accident Procedures
When you're in an accident and not seriously hurt, you need to act to prevent further damage or injury. The basic steps to be taken at any accident are to:
Protect the area. Notify authorities. Care for the injured.
2.20.1 - Protect the Area
The first thing to do at an accident scene is to keep another accident from happening in the same spot. To protect the accident area:
1. If your vehicle is involved in the accident, try to get it to the side of the road. This will help prevent another accident and allow traffic to move.
2. If you're stopping to help, park away from the accident. The area immediately around the accident will be needed for emergency vehicles.
3. Put on your flashers.
4. Set out reflective triangles to warn other traffic. Make sure other drivers can see them in time to avoid the accident.
