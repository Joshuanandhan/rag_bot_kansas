## 2.7.2 - Space Behind
You can't stop others from following you too closely. But there are things you can do to make it safer.
Stay to the Right. Heavy vehicles are often tailgated when they can't keep up with the speed of traffic. This often happens when you're going uphill. If a heavy load is slowing you down, stay in the right lane if you can. Going uphill, you should not pass another slow vehicle unless you can get around quickly and safely.
Dealing with Tailgaters Safely. In a large vehicle, it's often hard to see whether a vehicle is close behind you. You may be tailgated:
When you are traveling slowly. Drivers trapped behind slow vehicles often follow closely.
In bad weather. Many car drivers follow large vehicles closely during bad weather, especially when it is hard to see the road ahead.
If you find yourself being tailgated, here are some things you can do to reduce the chances of a crash: Avoid quick changes. If you have to slow down or turn, signal early, and reduce speed very gradually. Increase your following distance. Opening up room in front of you will help you to avoid having to make sudden speed or direction changes. It also makes it easier for the tailgater to get around you. Don't speed up. It's safer to be tailgated at a low speed than a high speed.
Avoid tricks. Don't turn on your taillights or flash your brake lights. Follow the suggestions above.
