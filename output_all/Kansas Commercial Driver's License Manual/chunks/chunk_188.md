## 4.2.4 - At Your Destination
When arriving at the destination or intermediate stops announce:
1. The location.
2. Reason for stopping.
3. Next departure time.
4. Bus number.
Remind riders to take carry-ons with them if they get off the bus. If the aisle is on a lower level than the seats, remind riders of the step-down. It is best to tell them before coming to a complete stop. Charter bus drivers should not allow riders on the bus until departure time. This will help prevent theft or vandalism of the bus.
