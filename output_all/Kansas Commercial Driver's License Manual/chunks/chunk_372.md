## 10.3.1 - Planning for Emergencies
Determine Need to Evacuate Bus. The first and most important consideration is for you to recognize the hazard. If time permits, school bus drivers should contact their dispatcher to explain the situation before making a decision to evacuate the school bus.
As a general rule, student safety and control is best maintained by keeping students on the bus during an emergency and/or impending crisis situation, if so doing does not expose them to unnecessary risk or injury. Remember, the decision to evacuate the bus must be a timely one.
A decision to evacuate should include consideration of the following conditions:
· Is there a fire or danger of fire?
· Is there a smell of raw or leaking fuel?
. Is there a chance the bus could be hit by other vehicles?
· Is the bus in the path of a sighted tornado or rising waters?
· Are there downed power lines?
· Would removing students expose them to speeding traffic, severe weather, or a dangerous environment such as downed power lines?
· Would moving students complicate injuries such as neck and back injuries and fractures?
· Is there a hazardous spill involved? Sometimes, it may be safer to remain on the bus and not come in contact with the material.
· Mandatory Evacuations. The driver must evacuate the bus when:
· The bus is on fire or there is a threat of a fire.
· The bus is stalled on or adjacent to a railroad-highway crossing.
· The position of the bus may change and increase the danger.
· There is an imminent danger of collision.
· There is a need to quickly evacuate because of a hazardous materials spill.
