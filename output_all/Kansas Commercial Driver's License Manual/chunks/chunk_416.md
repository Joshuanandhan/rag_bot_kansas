## Student Mirrors
In addition to checking the external mirrors, school bus drivers must also check the internal and external mirrors used for observing students:
Check for proper adjustment.
Checks that all internal and external mirrors and mirror brackets are not damaged and are mounted securely with no loose fittings.
Checks that visibility is not impaired due to dirty mirrors.
