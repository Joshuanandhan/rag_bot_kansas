## 10.1.3 - Outside Left and Right Side Flat Mirrors
These mirrors are mounted at the left and right front corners of the bus at the side or front of the windshield. They are used to monitor traffic, check clearances and students on the sides and to the rear of the bus. There is a blind spot immediately below and in front of each mirror and directly in back of the rear bumper. The blind spot behind the bus extends 5o to 150 feet and could extend up to 400 feet depending on the length and width of the bus.
Ensure that the mirrors are properly adjusted so you can see:
· 200 feet or 4 bus lengths behind the bus.
· Along the sides of the bus.
· The rear tires touching the ground.
Figure 10.2 shows how both the outside left and right side flat mirrors should be adjusted.
