## IMPORTANT NOTE
CDL holders in category 1 are required update their DOT medical card with the Kansas Department of Revenue, Division of Vehicles each time a new card is issued. Medical cards may be updated online at https://www.kdor.ks.gov/Apps/MotorVehicles/MotorVehicle/KCDLCertificate. If your DOT medical card on file expires, your CDL status will no longer be valid until a valid medical card is added to your record. If the DOT medical card on file expires for over 1-year, full CDL testing will be required to obtain a valid CDL again.
If you are unable to update your medical card online, you may obtain the Self-Certification form online at https://ksrevenue.gov/pdf/cdl_med_cert.pdf and send that, along with a copy of your DOT Medical Card to KDOR_Medical.Certification@ks.gov. To prevent delays, please ensure the medical card copy provided to the state is legible.

It is the responsibility of each CDL holder to send in their new DOT medical card and visit https://www.kdor.ks.gov/Apps/DLStatus/login.aspx to ensure the information on file is accurate. If your new medical card information is not updated after 2 business days, please follow up by emailing KDOR_Medical.Certification@ks.gov.
