## 9.3.5 - The Item Description
If a shipping paper describes both hazardous and non-hazardous products, the hazardous materials must be:
· Entered first. OR.
· Highlighted in a contrasting color, OR.
· Identified by an "X" placed before the shipping description (ID#, Shipping Name, Hazard Class, Packing Group) in a column captioned "HM". The letters "RQ" may be used instead of "X" if a reportable quantity needs to be identified.
The basic description of hazardous materials includes the identification number, proper shipping name, hazard class or division, and the packing group, if any, in that order. The packing group is displayed in Roman numerals and may be preceded by "PG".
Identification number, shipping name, and hazard class must not be abbreviated unless specifically authorized in the hazardous materials regulations. The description must also show:
· The total quantity and unit of measure.
· The number and type of packages (example: "6 Drums").
· The letters RQ, if a reportable quantity.
· If the letters RQ appear, the name of the hazardous substance (if not included in the shipping name).
· For all materials with the letter "G" (Generic) in Column 1, the technical name of the hazardous material.
Shipping papers also must list an emergency response telephone number (unless excepted). The emergency response telephone number is the responsibility of the shipper. It can be used by emergency
responders to obtain information about any hazardous materials involved in a spill or fire. The telephone number must be:
· The number of the person offering the hazardous material for transportation (if the shipper/offeror is the emergency response information (ERI) provider); or
· The number of an agency or organization capable of, and accepting responsibility for, providing the detailed information required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The person who is registered with the ERI provider must be identified by name, or contract number or other unique identifier assigned by the ERI provider, on the shipping paper
Shippers also must provide emergency response information to the motor carrier for each hazardous material being shipped. The emergency response information must be able to be used away from the motor vehicle and must provide information on how to safely handle incidents involving the material. At a minimum, it must include the following information:
· The basic description and technical name;
· Immediate hazards to health;
· Risks of fire or explosion;
· Immediate precautions to be taken in the event of an accident or incident;
· Immediate methods for handling fires;
· Initial methods for handling spills or leaks in the absence of fires; and
· Preliminary first aid measures
Such information can be on the shipping paper or some other document that includes the basic description and technical name of the hazardous material. Or, it may be in a guidance book such as the Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG). Motor carriers may assist shippers by keeping an ERG on each vehicle carrying hazardous materials. The driver must provide the emergency response information to any federal, state, or local authority responding to a hazardous materials incident or investigating one.
Total quantity and number & type of packages must appear before or after the basic description. The packaging type and the unit of measurement may be abbreviated. For example:
10 ctns. UN1263, Paint, 3, PG II, 500 lbs.
The shipper of hazardous wastes must put the word WASTE before the proper shipping name of the material on the shipping paper (hazardous waste manifest). For example:
UN1090, Waste Acetone, 3, PG II.
A non-hazardous material may not be described by using a hazard class or an identification number.
Shippers must keep a copy of shipping papers (or an electronic image) for a period of 2 years (3 years for hazardous waste) after the material is accepted by the initial carrier.
If one provides a carrier service only and is not the originator of the shipment, a carrier is required to keep a copy of the shipping paper (or an electronic image) for a period of 1 year.
IMPORTANT NOTE: To view complete regulatory requirements for the transportation of hazardous materials one should refer to the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49, Parts 171-185.
