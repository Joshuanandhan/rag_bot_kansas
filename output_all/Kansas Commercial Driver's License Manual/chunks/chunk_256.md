## Step 9. Lock Trailer Brakes
Pull out the "air supply" knob or move the tractor protection valve control from "normal" to "emergency."
Step 10. Back Under Trailer
1. Use lowest reverse gear.
2. Back tractor slowly under trailer to avoid hitting the kingpin too hard.
3. Stop when the kingpin is locked into the fifth wheel.
Step 11. Check Connection for Security
1. Raise trailer landing gear slightly off ground.
2. Pull tractor gently forward while the trailer brakes are still locked to check that the trailer is locked onto the tractor.
Step 12. Secure Vehicle
1. Put transmission in neutral.
2. Put parking brakes on.
3. Shut off engine and take key with you so someone else won't move truck while you are under it.
Step 13. Inspect Coupling
1. Use a flashlight, if necessary.
2. Make sure there is no space between upper and lower fifth wheel. If there is space, something is wrong (kingpin may be on top of the closed fifth wheel jaws, and trailer would come loose very easily).
3. Go under trailer and look into the back of the fifth wheel. Make sure the fifth wheel jaws have closed around the shank of the kingpin.
4. Check that the locking lever is in the "lock" position.
5. Check that the safety latch is in position over locking lever. (On some fifth wheels the catch must be put in place by hand.)
6. If the coupling isn't right, don't drive the coupled unit; get it fixed.
Step 14. Connect the Electrical Cord and Check Air-lines
1. Plug the electrical cord into the trailer and fasten the safety catch.
2. Check both air-lines and electrical line for signs of damage.
3. Make sure air and electrical lines will not hit any moving parts of vehicle.
