## Warning Signs of Fatigue
According to the National Sleep Foundation's Sleep in America poll, 60% of Americans have driven while feeling sleepy and 36% admit to having fallen asleep at the wheel in the past year. However, many people cannot tell if or when they are about to fall asleep. Here are some signs that should tell you to stop and rest:
· Difficulty focusing, frequent blinking or heavy eyelids
· Yawning repeatedly or rubbing eyes
· Daydreaming; or wandering/disconnected thoughts
· Trouble remembering the last few miles driven; missing exits or traffic signs
· Trouble keeping head up
· Drifting from your lane, following too closely, or hitting a shoulder rumble strip
· Feeling restless and irritable
· When you are tired trying to "push on" is far more dangerous than most drivers think. It is a major cause of fatal accidents. If you notice any signs of fatigue, stop driving and go to sleep for the night or take a 15 - 20-minute nap.
Are You at Risk?
Before you drive, consider whether you are:
· Sleep-deprived or fatigued (6 hours of sleep or less triples your risk)
· Suffering from sleep loss (insomnia), poor quality sleep, or a sleep debt
· Driving long distances without proper rest breaks
· Driving through the night, mid-afternoon or when you would normally be asleep. Many heavy motor vehicle accidents occur between midnight and 6 a.m.
· Taking sedating medications (antidepressants, cold tablets, antihistamines)
· Working more than 60 hours a week (increases your risk by 40%)
· Working more than one job, and your main job involves shift work
· Driving alone or on a long, rural, dark or boring road
· Flying, changing time zone
· Preventing drowsiness before a trip:
· Get adequate sleep - adults need 8 to 9 hours to maintain alertness
· Prepare route carefully to identify total distance, stopping points and other logistic considerations
· Schedule trips for the hours you are normally awake, not the middle of the night
· Drive with a passenger
· Avoid medications that cause drowsiness
· Consult your physician if you suffer from daytime sleepiness, have difficulty sleeping at night or take frequent naps
· Incorporate exercise into your daily life to give you more energy.
· Maintaining alertness while driving:
· Protect yourself from glare and eyestrain with sunglasses
· Keep cool by opening the window or using the air conditioner
· Avoid heavy foods
· Be aware of down time during the day
· Have another person ride with you, and take turns driving
· Take periodic breaks - about every 100 miles or 2 hours during long trips
· Stop driving and get some rest or take a nap
· Caffeine consumption can increase awareness for a few hours, but do not drink too much. It will eventually wear off. Do not rely on caffeine to prevent fatigue
· Avoid drugs. While they may keep you awake for a while, they won't make you alert.
If you are drowsy, the only safe cure is to get off the road and get some sleep. If you don't, you risk your life and the lives of others.
