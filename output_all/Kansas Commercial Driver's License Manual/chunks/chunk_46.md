## 2.1.1 - Why Inspect
Safety is the most important reason you inspect your vehicle, safety for yourself and for other road users. A vehicle defect found during an inspection could save you problems later. You could have a breakdown on the road that will cost time and dollars, or even worse, a crash caused by the defect.
Federal and state laws require that drivers inspect their vehicles. Federal and state inspectors also may inspect your vehicles. If they judge the vehicle to be unsafe, they will put it "out of service" until it is fixed.
2.1.2 - Types of Vehicle Inspection
Vehicle Inspection. A Vehicle inspection will help you find problems that could cause a crash or breakdown.
During a Trip. For safety you should:
1. Watch gauges for signs of trouble.
2. Use your senses to check for problems (look, listen, smell, feel).
3. Check critical items when you stop:
4. Tires, wheels, and rims.
5. Brakes.
. Lights and reflectors.
7. Brake and electrical connections to trailer.
8. Trailer coupling devices.
9. Cargo securement devices.
After-trip Inspection and Report. You should do an after-trip inspection at the end of the trip, day, or tour of duty on each vehicle you operated. It may include filling out a vehicle condition report listing any problems you find. The inspection report helps a motor carrier know when the vehicle needs repairs.
