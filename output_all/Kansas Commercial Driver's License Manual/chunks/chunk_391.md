## 11.1 All Vehicles
Study the following vehicle parts for the type of vehicle you will be using during the CDL skills tests. You should be able to identify each part and tell the examiner what you are looking for or inspecting.
11.1.1 Engine Compartment (Engine Off)
Leaks/Hoses Look for puddles on the ground. Look for dripping fluids on underside of engine and transmission. Inspect hoses for condition and leaks.
Oil Level Check oil level when engine is off.
Indicate where dipstick is located.
Check that the oil level is within safe operating range. Level must be above refill mark.
Coolant Level
Looks at sight glass on radiator or coolant reservoir; adequate level will show in sight glass. If no sight glass is available, you must describe what s/he would look for after removing radiator cap.
Power Steering Fluid
Checks the dipstick and sees where the fluid level is relative to the refill mark or checks sight glass. Level must be above refill mark.
Engine Compartment Belts Check the following belts for snugness (1/2 to 3/4-inch play at center of belt), cracks, frays, loose fibers or signs of wear:
· Power steering belt.
· Water pump belt.
· Alternator belt.
· Air compressor belt.
Note: If any of the components listed above are not belt driven, you must:
· Tell the examiner which component(s) are not belt driven.
· Make sure component(s) are operating properly, are not damaged or leaking, and are mounted securely.
Hydraulic Brakes Master Cylinder & Brake Fluid Checks that master cylinder is securely attached and not leaking. Checks the level of brake fluid in the reservoir to ensure it is between the add and full marks.
Safe Start Place gearshift lever in neutral (or park, for automatic transmissions).
Depress clutch before attempting to start the vehicle. Start the vehicle and keep clutch depressed until engine reaches idling speed. Then release clutch slowly.
11.1.2 - Cab Check/Engine Start
Oil Pressure Gauge
Make sure oil pressure gauge is working.
Check that pressure gauge shows increasing or normal oil pressure or that the warning light goes off. If equipped, oil temperature gauge should begin a gradual rise to the normal operating range.
