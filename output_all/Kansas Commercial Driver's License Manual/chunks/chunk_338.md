## 9.5.2 - Tank Loading
The person in charge of loading and unloading a cargo tank must be sure a qualified person is always watching. This person watching the loading or unloading must:
· Be alert.
· Have a clear view of the cargo tank.
· Be within 25 feet of the tank.
· Know of the hazards of the materials involved.
· Know the procedures to follow in an emergency.
· Be authorized to move the cargo tank and able to do so.
There are special attendance rules for cargo tanks transporting propane and anhydrous ammonia.
Close all manholes and valves before moving a tank of hazardous materials, no matter how small the amount in the tank or how short the distance. Manholes and valves must be closed to prevent leaks. It is illegal to move a cargo tank with open valves or covers unless it is empty according to 49 CFR 173.29.
