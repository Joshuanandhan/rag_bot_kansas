## Tires
The following items must be inspected on every tire: Tread depth: Check for minimum tread depth (4/32 on steering axle tires, 2/32 on all other tires). Tire condition: Check that tread is evenly worn and look for cuts or other damage to tread or sidewalls. Also, make sure that valve caps and stems are not missing, broken, or damaged. Tire inflation: Check for proper inflation by using a tire gauge. Note: You will not get credit if you simply kick the tires or use a mallet to check for proper inflation.
