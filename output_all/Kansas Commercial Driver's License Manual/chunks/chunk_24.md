![Make the Call, Save Lives. Kevin Kimmel, truck driver for Con-way Truckload and winner of TAT's 2015 Harriet Tubman Award]()
In January 2015, an RV pulled into a truck stop in Virginia. Observant professional truck driver Kevin Kimmel recognized suspicious activity around that RV, which had pulled back by the truck line, and decided something was off. Instead of turning a blind eye, he made a call that brought law enforcement out to the scene within a few minutes. After interviewing the occupants of the vehicle, they discovered that a young woman, 20 years old, had been kidnapped from lowa two weeks prior. She had been beaten, raped, her whole body burned by instruments heated on the RV stove, branded and starved. She was being sold by her traffickers, Laura Sorenson and Aldair Hodza, through sex ads on Craigslist, where men were purchasing her and then arriving at the RV to rape her. She was dying from malnutrition and the torture she was subjected to ... had the call not been made that brought law enforcement out to that truck stop, doctors said she would have died within the next few days. Now a recovering survivor, this young woman calls Kimmel her guardian angel. He calls himself a Trucker Against Trafficking.
