## 2.20.3 - Care for the Injured
If a qualified person is at the accident and helping the injured, stay out of the way unless asked to assist. Otherwise, do the best you can to help any injured parties. Here are some simple steps to follow in giving assistance:
1. Don't move a severely injured person unless the danger of fire or passing traffic makes it necessary.
2. Stop heavy bleeding by applying direct pressure to the wound.
3. Keep the injured person warm.
