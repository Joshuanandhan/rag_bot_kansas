## Precautions for Specific Hazards
Class 1 (Explosives) Materials. Turn your engine off before loading or unloading any explosives. Then check the cargo space. You must:
· Disable cargo heaters. Disconnect heater power sources and drain heater fuel tanks.
· Make sure there are no sharp points that might damage cargo. Look for bolts, screws, nails, broken side panels, and broken floorboards.
· Use a floor lining with Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3. The floors must be tight and the liner must be either non-metallic material or non-ferrous metal. (Non-ferrous metals are any metal that does not contain iron or iron alloys).
Use extra care to protect explosives. Never use hooks or other metal tools. Never drop, throw, or roll packages. Protect explosive packages from other cargo that might cause damage.
Do not transfer a Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 from one vehicle to another on a public roadway except in an emergency. If safety requires an emergency transfer, set out red warning reflectors, flags, or electric lanterns. You must warn others on the road.
Never transport damaged packages of explosives. Do not take a package that shows any dampness or oily stain.
Do not transport Division 1.1 or 1.2 in vehicle combinations if:
· There is a marked or placarded cargo tank in the combination.
· The other vehicle in the combination contains:
· Division 1.1 A (Initiating Explosives).
· Packages of Class 7 (Radioactive) materials labeled "Yellow III."
· Division 2.3 (Poisonous Gas) Hazard zone A or B or Division 6.1 (Poisonous) materials Hazard zone A.
· Hazardous materials in a portable tank, on a DOT Spec 106A or 110A tank.
Class 4 (Flammable Solids) and Class 5 (Oxidizers) Materials. Class 4 materials are solids that react (including fire and explosion) to water, heat, and air or even react spontaneously.
Class 4 and 5 materials must be completely enclosed in a vehicle or covered securely. Class 4 and 5 materials, which become unstable and dangerous when wet, must be kept dry while in transit and during loading and unloading. Materials that are subject to spontaneous combustion or heating must be in vehicles with sufficient ventilation.
Class 8 (Corrosive) Materials. If loading by hand, load breakable containers of corrosive liquid one by one. Keep them right side up. Do not drop or roll the containers. Load them onto an even floor surface. Stack carboys only if the lower tiers can bear the weight of the upper tiers safely.
Do not load nitric acid above any other product. Load charged storage batteries so their liquid won't spill. Keep them right side up. Make sure other cargo won't fall against or short circuit them.
Never load corrosive liquids next to or above:
· Division 1.4 (Explosives C).
· Division 4.1 (Flammable Solids).
· Division 4.3 (Dangerous When Wet).
· Class 5 (Oxidizers).
· Division 2.3, Zone B (Poisonous Gases).
Never load corrosive liquids with:
· Division 1.1 or 1.2
· Division 1.3
· Division 1.5 (Blasting Agents).
· Division 2.3, Zone A (Poisonous Gases).
· Division 4.2 (Spontaneously Combustible Materials).
· Division 6.1, PGI, Zone A (Poison Liquids).
Class 2 (Compressed Gases) Including Cryogenic Liquids. If your vehicle doesn't have racks to hold cylinders, the cargo space floor must be flat. The cylinders must be:
· Held upright.
· In racks attached to the vehicle or in boxes that will keep them from turning over.
· Cylinders may be loaded in a horizontal position (lying down) if it is designed so the relief valve is in the vapor space.
Division 2.3 (Poisonous Gas) or Division 6.1 (Poisonous) Materials. Never transport these materials in containers with interconnections. Never load a package labeled POISON or POISON INHALATION HAZARD in the driver's cab or sleeper or with food material for human or animal consumption. There are special rules for loading and unloading Class 2 materials in cargo tanks. You must have special training to do this.
