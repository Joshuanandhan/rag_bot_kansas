## 10.2.6 - Post-trip Inspection
When your route or school activity trip is finished, you should conduct a post-trip inspection of the bus. You should walk through the bus and around the bus looking for the following:
· Articles left on the bus.
· Sleeping students.
· Open windows and doors.
· Mechanical/operational problems with the bus, with special attention to items that are unique to school buses - mirror systems, flashing warning lamps and stop signal arms.
· Damage or vandalism.
· Any problems or special situations should be reported immediately to your supervisor or school authorities.
