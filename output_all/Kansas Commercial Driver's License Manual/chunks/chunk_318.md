Figure 9.1 A shipping paper describes the hazardous materials being transported. Shipping orders, bills of lading, and manifests are all shipping papers. Figure 9.6 shows an example shipping paper.
After an accident or hazardous materials spill or leak, you may be injured and unable to communicate the hazards of the materials you are transporting. Firefighters and police can prevent or reduce the amount of damage or injury at the scene if they know what hazardous materials are being carried. Your life, and the lives of others, may depend on quickly locating the hazardous materials shipping papers. For that reason, the rules require:
· Shippers to describe hazardous materials correctly and include an emergency response telephone number on shipping papers.
· Carriers and drivers to quickly identify hazardous materials shipping papers, or keep them on top of other shipping papers and keep the required emergency response information with the shipping papers.
Drivers to keep hazardous materials shipping papers:
· In a pouch on the driver's door, or
· In clear view within immediate reach while the seat belt is fastened while driving, or
· On the driver's seat when out of the vehicle.
