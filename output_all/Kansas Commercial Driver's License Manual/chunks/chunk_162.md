## 3.1 - Inspecting Cargo
As part of your Vehicle inspection, make sure the truck is not overloaded and the cargo is balanced and secured properly. After starting, inspect the cargo and its securing devices again within the first 50 miles after beginning a trip. Make any adjustments needed. Re-check the cargo and securing devices as often as necessary during a trip to keep the load secure. You need to inspect again:
· After you have driven for 3 hours or 150 miles.
· After every break you take during driving.
Federal, state, and local regulations for commercial vehicle weight, securing cargo, covering loads, and where you can drive large vehicles vary from place to place. Know the rules where you will be driving.
