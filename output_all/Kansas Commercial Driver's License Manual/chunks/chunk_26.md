## Section 1- Introduction
This Section Covers:
· Commercial Driver's License Exams
· Medical Requirements
· Driver Disqualifications
· Other Safety Rules
· International Registration Program
There is a federal requirement that each state have minimum standards for the licensing of commercial drivers.
This manual provides driver license testing information for drivers who wish to have a commercial driver license (CDL). This manual does NOT provide information on all the federal and state requirements needed before you can drive a commercial motor vehicle (CMV).
You must have a CDL to operate:
· Any single vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 26,001 pounds or more.
· A combination vehicle with a gross combination weight rating (GCWR) of 26,001 or more pounds, provided the GVWR of the vehicle(s) being towed is in excess of 10,000 pounds.
· A vehicle designed to transport 16 or more passengers (including the driver).
· Any size vehicle which requires hazardous material placards or is carrying material listed as a select agent or toxin in 42 CFR part 73. Federal regulations through the Department of Homeland Security require a background check and fingerprinting for the Hazardous Materials endorsement. Contact your local department of driver licensing for more information.
