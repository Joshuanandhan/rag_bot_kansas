## Hydraulic Brake Check
Failure to perform both components of the hydraulic brake check will result in an automatic failure of the vehicle inspection test.
1. Pump the brake pedal three times, then hold it down for five seconds. The brake pedal should not move (depress) during the five seconds.
2. If equipped with a hydraulic brake reserve (back-up) system, with the key off, depress the brake pedal and listen for the sound of the reserve system electric motor.
3. Check that the warning buzzer or light is off.
