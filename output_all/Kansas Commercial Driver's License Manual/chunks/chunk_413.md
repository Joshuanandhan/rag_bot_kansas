## Mounting Bolts
Look for loose or missing mounting brackets, clamps, bolts, or nuts. Both the fifth wheel and the slide mounting must be solidly attached.
Check for loose or missing mounting bolts and for broken welds for pintle hook or other type of hitch mount, and tongue/draw-bar assembly to ensure that they are solidly attached in place. On other types of coupling systems (i.e., ball hitch, pintle hook, etc.), inspect all coupling components and mounting brackets for missing or broken parts.
Hitch Release Lever Check to see that the hitch release lever is in place and is secure.
Locking Jaws Look into fifth wheel gap and check that locking jaws are fully closed around the kingpin. On other types of coupling systems (i.e., ball hitch, pintle hook, etc.), inspect the locking mechanism for missing or broken parts and make sure it is locked securely. If present, safety cables or chains must be secure and free of kinks and excessive slack.
5th Wheel Skid Plate Check for proper lubrication and that 5th wheel skid plate is securely mounted to the platform and that all bolts and pins are secure and not missing.
Platform (Fifth Wheel)
Check for cracks or breaks in the platform structure which supports the fifth wheel skid plate.
Release Arm (Fifth Wheel) If equipped, make sure the release arm is in the engaged position and the safety latch is in place.
Kingpin/Apron/Gap Explain that locking jaws holds kingpin in place and that the kingpin is not bent or damaged Make sure the visible part of the apron is not bent, cracked, or broken. Check that the trailer is lying flat on the fifth wheel skid plate (no gap). Check for kingpin lock.
Locking Pins (Fifth Wheel)
If equipped, look for loose or missing pins in the slide mechanism of the sliding fifth wheel. If air powered, check for leaks.
Make sure locking pins are fully engaged.
Check that the fifth wheel is positioned properly so that the tractor frame will clear the landing gear during turns.
Sliding Pintle Check the sliding pintle hook for excessive wear and to ensure it is secure with no loose or missing nuts or bolts and cotter pin is in place.
Tongue or Draw-bar Check that the tongue/draw-bar is not bent or twisted and checks for broken welds and stress cracks. Check that the tongue/draw-bar eye is not worn excessively.
Tongue Storage Area Check that the storage area is solid and secured to the tongue. Check that cargo in the storage area i.e. chains, binders, etc. are secure.
