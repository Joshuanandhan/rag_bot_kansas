## 2.3.1 - Manual Transmissions
Basic Method for Shifting Up. Most heavy vehicles with unsynchronized manual transmissions require double clutching to change gears. If equipped with a synchronized manual transmission, double clutching is NOT required This is the basic method:
Release accelerator, push in clutch and shift to neutral at the same time. Release clutch.
Let engine and gears slow down to the rpm required for the next gear (this takes practice). Push in clutch and shift to the higher gear at the same time. Release clutch and press accelerator at the same time.
Shifting gears using double clutching requires practice. If you remain too long in neutral, you may have difficulty putting the vehicle into the next gear. If so, don't try to force it. Return to neutral, release clutch, increase engine speed to match road speed, and try again.
Knowing When to Shift Up. There are two ways of knowing when to shift:
1. Use Engine Speed (rpm). Study the driver's manual for your vehicle and learn the operating rpm range. Watch your tachometer and shift up when your engine reaches the top of the range. (Some newer vehicles use "progressive" shifting: the rpm at which you shift becomes higher as you move up in the gears. Find out what's right for the vehicle you will operate.)
2. Use Road Speed (mph). Learn what speeds each gear is good for. Then, by using the speedometer, you'll know when to shift up.
With either method, you may learn to use engine sounds to know when to shift.
Basic Procedures for Shifting Down
1. Release accelerator, push in clutch, and shift to neutral at the same time.
2. Release clutch.
3. Press accelerator, increase engine and gear speed to the rpm required in the lower gear.
4. Push in clutch and shift to lower gear at the same time.
5. Release clutch and press accelerator at the same time.
6. Downshifting, like upshifting, requires knowing when to shift. Use either the tachometer or the speedometer and downshift at the right rpm or road speed.
Special conditions where you should downshift are:
· Before Starting Down a Hill. Slow down and shift down to a speed that you can control without using the brakes hard. Otherwise, the brakes can overheat and lose their braking power.
· Downshift before starting down the hill. Make sure you are in a low enough gear, usually lower than the gear required to climb the same hill.
· Before Entering a Curve. Slow down to a safe speed, and downshift to the right gear before entering the curve. This lets you use some power through the curve to help the vehicle be more stable while turning. It also allows you to speed up as soon as you are out of the curve.
