## 6.4.1 - Coupling Tractor-Semitrailers
Step 1. Inspect Fifth Wheel
1. Check for damaged/missing parts.
2. Check to see that mounting to tractor is secure, no cracks in frame, etc.
3. Be sure that the fifth wheel plate is greased as required. Failure to keep the fifth wheel plate lubricated could cause steering problems because of friction between the tractor and trailer.
4. Check if fifth wheel is in proper position for coupling:
5. Wheel tilted down toward rear of tractor.
6. Jaws open.
7. Safety unlocking handle in the automatic lock position.
8. If you have a sliding fifth wheel, make sure it is locked.
9. Make sure the trailer kingpin is not bent or broken.
Step 2. Inspect Area and Chock Wheels
1. Make sure area around the vehicle is clear.
2. Be sure trailer wheels are chocked or spring brakes are on.
3. Check that cargo (if any) is secured against movement due to tractor being coupled to the trailer.
