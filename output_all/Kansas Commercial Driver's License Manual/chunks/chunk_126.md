## 2.15.3 - Driving Procedures
Never Race a Train to a Crossing. Never attempt to race a train to a crossing. It is extremely difficult to judge the speed of an approaching train.
Reduce Speed. Speed must be reduced in accordance with your ability to see approaching trains in any direction, and speed must be held to a point which will permit you to stop short of the tracks in case a stop is necessary.
Don't Expect to Hear a Train. Trains may not or are prohibited from sounding horns when approaching some crossings. Public crossings where trains do not sound horns should be identified by signs. Noise inside your vehicle may, also prevent you from hearing the train horn until the train is dangerously close to the crossing.
Don't Rely on Signals. You should not rely solely upon the presence of warning signals, gates, or flagmen to warn of the approach of trains. Be especially alert at crossings that do not have gates or flashing red light signals.
Double Tracks Require a Double Check. Remember that a train on one track may hide a train on the other track. Look both ways before crossing. After one train has cleared a crossing, be sure no other trains are near before starting across the tracks.
Yard Areas and Grade Crossings in Cities and Towns. Yard areas and grade crossings in cities and towns are just as dangerous as rural grade crossings. Approach them with as much caution.
2.15.4 - Stopping Safely at Railroad- highway Crossings A full stop is required at grade crossings whenever: The nature of the cargo makes a stop mandatory under state or federal regulations. Such a stop is otherwise required by law.
When stopping be sure to:
· Check for traffic behind you while stopping gradually. Use a pullout lane, if available.
· Turn on your four-way emergency flashers.
