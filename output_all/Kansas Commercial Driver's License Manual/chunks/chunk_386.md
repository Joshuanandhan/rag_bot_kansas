## 10.7.2 - Driving in High Winds
Strong winds affect the handling of the school bus! The side of a school bus acts like a sail on a sailboat. Strong winds can push the school bus sideways. They can even move the school bus off the road or, in extreme conditions, tip it over.
If you are caught in strong winds:
· Keep a strong grip on the steering wheel. Try to anticipate gusts.
. You should slow down to lessen the effect of the wind, or pull off the roadway and wait.
· Contact your dispatcher to get more information on how to proceed.
