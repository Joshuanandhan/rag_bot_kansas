## Connect Converter Dolly to Rear Trailer
1. Make sure trailer brakes are locked and/or wheels chocked.
2. Make sure trailer height is correct. (It must be slightly lower than the center of the fifth wheel, so trailer is raised slightly when dolly is pushed under.)
3. Back converter dolly under rear trailer.
4. Raise landing gear slightly off ground to prevent damage if trailer moves.
5. Test coupling by pulling against pin of the second semitrailer.
6. Make visual check of coupling. (No space between upper and lower fifth wheel. Locking jaws closed on kingpin.)
7. Connect safety chains, air hoses, and light cords.
8. Close converter dolly air tank petcock and shut-off valves at rear of second trailer (service and emergency shut-offs).
9. Open shut-off valves at rear of first trailer (and on dolly if so equipped).
10. Raise landing gear completely.
11. Charge trailer brakes (push "air supply" knob in), and check for air at rear of second trailer by opening the emergency line shut-off. If air pressure isn't there, something is wrong and the brakes won't work.
