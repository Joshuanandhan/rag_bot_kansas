## 10.7.3 - Backing
Backing a school bus is strongly discouraged. You should back your bus only when you have no other safe way to move the vehicle. You should never back a school bus when students are outside of the bus. Backing is dangerous and increases your risk of a collision. If you have no choice and you must back your bus, follow these procedures:
1. Post a lookout. The purpose of the lookout is to warn you about obstacles, approaching persons, and other vehicles. The lookout should not give directions on how to back the bus.
2. Signal for quiet on the bus.
3. Constantly check all mirrors and rear windows.
4. Back slowly and smoothly.
5. If no lookout is available:
6. Set the parking brake.
7. Turn off the motor and take the keys with you.
8. Walk to the rear of the bus to determine whether the way is clear.
If you must back-up at a student pick-up point, be sure to pick up students before backing and watch for late comers at all times.
Be sure that all students are in the bus before backing. If you must back-up at a student drop-off point, be sure to unload students after backing.
