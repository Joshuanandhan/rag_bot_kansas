## 8.1.1 - Leaks
On all tank vehicles, the most important item to check for is leaks. Check under and around the vehicle for signs of any leaking. Don't carry liquids or gases in a leaking tank. To do so is a crime. You will be cited and prevented from driving further. You may also be liable for the clean-up of any spill. In general, check the following:
1. Check the tank's body or shell for dents or leaks.
2. Check the intake, discharge, and cut-off valves. Make sure the valves are in the correct position before loading, unloading, or moving the vehicle.
3. Check pipes, connections, and hoses for leaks, especially around joints.
4. Check manhole covers and vents. Make sure the covers have gaskets and they close correctly. Keep the vents clear so they work correctly.
