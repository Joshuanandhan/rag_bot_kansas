## 2.9.3 - Types of Distractions
There are many causes of distraction, all with the potential to increase risk.
Physical distraction - one that causes you to take your hands off the wheel or eyes off the road, such as reaching for an object.
Mental distraction - activities that take your mind away from the road, such as engaging in conversation with a passenger or thinking about something that happened during the day.
Both physical and mental distraction - even greater chance a crash could happen, such as talking on a cell phone; or sending or reading text messages.
