## 10.3.2 - Evacuation Procedures
Be Prepared and Plan Ahead. When possible, assign two responsible, older student assistants to each emergency exit. Teach them how to assist the other students off the bus. Assign another student assistant to lead the students to a "safe place" after evacuation. However, you must recognize that there may not be older, responsible students on the bus at the time of the emergency. Therefore, emergency evacuation procedures must be explained to all students. This includes knowing how to operate the various emergency exits and the importance of listening to and following all instructions given by you.
Some tips to determine a safe place:
. A safe place will be at least 100 feet off the road in the direction of oncoming traffic. This will keep the students from being hit by debris if another vehicle collides with the bus.
· Lead students upwind of the bus if fire is present.
· Lead students as far away from railroad tracks as possible and in the direction of any oncoming train.
· Lead students upwind of the bus at least 300 feet if there is a risk from spilled hazardous materials.
If the bus is in the direct path of a sighted tornado and evacuation is ordered, escort students to a nearby ditch or culvert if shelter in a building is not readily available, and direct them to lie face down, hands covering their head. They should be far enough away so the bus cannot topple on them. Avoid areas that are subject to flash floods.
General Procedures. Determine if evacuation is in the best interest of safety. Determine the best type of evacuation:
· Front, rear or side door evacuation, or some combination of doors.
· Roof or window evacuation.
