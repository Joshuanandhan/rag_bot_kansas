## 2.7.7 - Space Needed to Cross or Enter Traffic
Be aware of the size and weight of your vehicle when you cross or enter traffic. Here are some important things to keep in mind.
Because of slow acceleration and the space large vehicles require, you may need a much larger gap to enter traffic than you would in a car. Acceleration varies with the load. Allow more room if your vehicle is heavily loaded. Before you start across a road, make sure you can get all the way across before traffic reaches you.
