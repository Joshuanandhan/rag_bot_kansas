## 2.4.2 - Seeing to the Sides and Rear
It's important to know what's going on behind and to the sides. Check your mirrors regularly. Check more often in special situations.
Mirror Adjustment. Mirror adjustment should be checked prior to the start of any trip and can only be checked accurately when the trailer(s) are straight. You should check and adjust each mirror to show some part of the vehicle. This will give you a reference point for judging the position of the other images.
Regular Checks. You need to make regular checks of your mirrors to be aware of traffic and to check your vehicle.
Traffic. Check your mirrors for vehicles on either side and in back of you. In an emergency, you may need to know whether you can make a quick lane change. Use your mirrors to spot overtaking vehicles. There are "blind spots" that your mirrors cannot show you. Check your mirrors regularly to know where other vehicles are around you, and to see if they move into your blind spots.
Check Your Vehicle. Use the mirrors to keep an eye on your tires. It's one way to spot a tire fire. If you're carrying open cargo, you can use the mirrors to check it. Look for loose straps, ropes, or chains. Watch for a flapping or ballooning tarp.
Special Situations. Special situations require more than regular mirror checks. These are lane changes, turns, merges, and tight maneuvers.
Lane Changes. You need to check your mirrors to make sure no one is alongside you or about to pass you. Check your mirrors:
Before you change lanes to make sure there is enough room.
After you have signaled, to check that no one has moved into your blind spot.
Right after you start the lane change, to double-check that your path is clear. After you complete the lane change.
Turns. In turns, check your mirrors to make sure the rear of your vehicle will not hit anything.
Merges. When merging, use your mirrors to make sure the gap in traffic is large enough for you to enter safely.
Tight Maneuvers. Any time you are driving in close quarters, check your mirrors often. Make sure you have enough clearance.
How to Use Mirrors. Use mirrors correctly by checking them quickly and understanding what you see. When you use your mirrors while driving on the road, check quickly. Look back and forth between the mirrors and the road ahead. Don't focus on the mirrors for too long. Otherwise, you will travel quite a distance without knowing what's happening ahead.
Many large vehicles have curved (convex, "fisheye," "spot," "bug-eye") mirrors that show a wider area than flat mirrors. This is often helpful. But everything appears smaller in a convex mirror than it would if you were looking at it directly. Things also seem farther away than they really are. It's important to realize this and to allow for it. Figure 2.7 shows the field of vision using a convex mirror.
