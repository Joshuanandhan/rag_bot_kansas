## 2.12 - Driving in Fog
Fog can occur at any time. Fog on highways can be extremely dangerous. Fog is often unexpected, and visibility can deteriorate rapidly. You should watch for foggy conditions and be ready to reduce your speed. Do not assume that the fog will thin out after you enter it.
The best advice for driving in fog is don't. It is preferable that you pull off the road into a rest area or truck stop until visibility is better. If you must drive, be sure to consider the following:
· Obey all fog-related warning signs.
· Slow down before you enter fog.
· Use low-beam headlights and fog lights for best visibility even in daytime and be alert for other drivers who may have forgotten to turn on their lights.
· Turn on your 4-way flashers. This will give vehicles approaching you from behind a quicker opportunity to notice your vehicle.
· Watch for vehicles on the side of the roadway. Seeing taillights or headlights in front of you may not be a true indication of where the road is ahead of you. The vehicle may not be on the road at all.
· Use roadside highway reflectors as guides to determine how the road may curve ahead of you.
· Listen for traffic you cannot see.
· Avoid passing other vehicles.
· Don't stop along the side of the road, unless necessary.
