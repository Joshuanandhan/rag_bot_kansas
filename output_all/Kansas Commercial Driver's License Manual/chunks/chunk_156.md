## What is a drink?
It is the alcohol in drinks that affects human performance. It doesn't make any difference whether that alcohol comes from "a couple of beers," or from two glasses of wine, or two shots of hard liquor. Approximate Blood Alcohol Content

Subtract .01% for each 40 minutes of drinking. One drink is 1.5 oz. of 80 proof liquor, 12 oz. of beer, or 5 oz. of table wine.
Figure 2.22
All of the following drinks contain the same amount of alcohol:
· A 12-ounce glass of 5% beer.
· A 5-ounce glass of 12% wine.
· A 1 1/2-ounce shot of 80 proof liquor.
What Determines Blood Alcohol Concentration? BAC is determined by the amount of alcohol you drink (more alcohol means higher BAC), how fast you drink (faster drinking means higher BAC), and your weight (a small person doesn't have to drink as much to reach the same BAC).
Alcohol and the Brain. Alcohol affects more and more of the brain as BAC builds up. The first part of the brain affected controls judgment and self-control. One of the bad things about this is it can keep drinkers from knowing they are getting drunk. And, of course, good judgment and self-control are necessary for safe driving. As BAC continues to build up, muscle control, vision, and coordination are affected more and more. Effects on driving may include:
· Straddling lanes.
· Quick, jerky starts.
· Not signaling, failure to use lights.
· Running stop signs and red lights.
· Improper passing (See Figure 2.23).
These effects mean increased chances of a crash and chances of losing your driver's license. Accident statistics show that the chance of a crash is much greater for drivers who have been drinking than for drivers who have not.
How Alcohol Affects Driving. All drivers are affected by drinking alcohol. Alcohol affects judgment, vision, coordination, and reaction time. It causes serious driving errors, such as:
· Increased reaction time to hazards.
· Driving too fast or too slowly.
· Driving in the wrong lane.
· Running over the curb.
· Weaving.
Blood Alcohol Content is the amount of alcohol in your blood recorded in milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. Your BAC depends on the amount of blood (which increases with weight) and the amount of alcohol you consume over time (how fast you drink). The faster you drink, the higher your BAC, as the liver can only handle about one drink per hour-the rest builds up in your blood.
