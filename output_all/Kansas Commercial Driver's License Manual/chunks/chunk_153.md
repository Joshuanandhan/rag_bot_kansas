## 2.21.3 - Fire Fighting
Knowing how to fight fires is important. Drivers who didn't know what to do have made fires worse. Know how the fire extinguisher works. Study the instructions printed on the extinguisher before you need it. Here are some procedures to follow in case of fire.
· Pull Off the Road. The first step is to get the vehicle off the road and stop. In doing so:
· Park in an open area, away from buildings, trees, brush, other vehicles, or anything that might catch fire.
· Don't pull into a service station!
· Notify emergency services of your problem and your location.
Keep the Fire from Spreading. Before trying to put out the fire, make sure that it doesn't spread any further. With an engine fire, turn off the engine as soon as you can. Don't open the hood if you can avoid it. Shoot foam through louvers, radiator, or from the vehicle's underside.
For a cargo fire in a van or box trailer, keep the doors shut, especially if your cargo contains hazardous materials. Opening the van doors will supply the fire with oxygen and can cause it to burn very fast.
Extinguish the Fire. Here are some rules to follow in putting out a fire:
1. When using the extinguisher, stay as far away from the fire as possible.
2. Aim at the source or base of the fire, not up in the flames.
3. Use the Right Fire Extinguisher
· The B:C type fire extinguisher is designed to work on electrical fires and burning liquids.
· The A:B:C type is designed to work on burning wood, paper, and cloth as well.
· Water can be used on wood, paper, or cloth, but don't use water on an electrical fire (can cause shock) or a gasoline fire (it will spread the flames).
· A burning tire must be cooled. Lots of water may be required.
· If you're not sure what to use, especially on a hazardous materials fire, wait for firefighters.
· Position yourself upwind. Let the wind carry the extinguisher to the fire.
· Continue until whatever was burning has been cooled. Absence of smoke or flame does not mean the fire cannot restart.
| Class | Type |
|---|---|
| A | Wood, Paper, Ordinary Combustibles<br>Extinguish by Cooling and Quenching Using Water or Dry Chemicals |
| B | Gasoline, Oil, Grease, Other Greasy Liquids<br>Extinguish by Smothering, Cooling or Heat Shielding using carbon Dioxide or Dry Chemicals |
| C | Electrical Equipment Fires<br>Extinguish with Non-Conducting Agents such as Carbon Dioxide or Dry Chemicals. DO NOT USE WATER. |
| D | Fires in Combustible Metals<br>Extinguish by Using Specialized Extinguishing Powders |
