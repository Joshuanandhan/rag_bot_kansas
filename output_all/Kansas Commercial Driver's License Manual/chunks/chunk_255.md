## Step 6. Check Trailer Height
1. The trailer should be low enough that it is raised slightly by the tractor when the tractor is backed under it. Raise or lower the trailer as needed. (If the trailer is too low, the tractor may strike and damage the trailer nose; if the trailer is too high, it may not couple correctly.)
2. Check that the kingpin and fifth wheel are aligned.
Step 7. Connect Air-lines to Trailer
1. Check glad hand seals and connect tractor emergency air-line to trailer emergency glad hand.
2. Check glad hand seals and connect tractor service air-line to trailer service glad hand.
3. Make sure air-lines are safely supported where they won't be crushed or caught while tractor is backing under the trailer.
Step 8. Supply Air to Trailer
1. From cab, push in "air supply" knob or move tractor protection valve control from the "emergency" to the "normal" position to supply air to the trailer brake system.
2. Wait until the air pressure is normal.
3. Check brake system for crossed air-lines.
4. Shut engine off so you can hear the brakes.
5. Apply and release trailer brakes and listen for sound of trailer brakes being applied and released. You should hear the brakes move when applied and air escape when the brakes are released.
6. Check air brake system pressure gauge for signs of major air loss.
7. When you are sure trailer brakes are working, start engine.
8. Make sure air pressure is up to normal.
