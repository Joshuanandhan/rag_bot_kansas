## 10.6.5 - Safety Reminders
. ABS won't allow you to drive faster, follow more closely, or drive less carefully.
· ABS won't prevent power or turning skids - ABS should prevent brake-induced skids but not those caused by spinning the drive wheels or going too fast in a turn.
· ABS won't necessarily shorten stopping distance. ABS will help maintain vehicle control, but not always shorten stopping distance.
· ABS won't increase or decrease ultimate stopping power - ABS is an "add-on" to your normal brakes, not a replacement for them.
· ABS won't change the way you normally brake. Under normal brake conditions, your vehicle will stop as it always stopped. ABS only comes into play when a wheel would normally have locked up because of over braking.
· ABS won't compensate for bad brakes or poor brake maintenance.
Remember: The best vehicle safety feature is still a safe driver. Remember: Drive so you never need to use your ABS. Remember: If you need it, ABS could help to prevent a serious crash.
