## 2.6.7 - Roadway Work Zones
Speeding traffic is the number one cause of injury and death in roadway work zones. Always observe the posted speed limits when approaching and driving through a work zone. Watch your speedometer, and don't allow your speed to creep up as you drive through long sections of road construction. Decrease your speed for adverse weather or road conditions. Decrease your speed even further when a worker is close to the roadway.
