Additional Procedures for Students That Must Cross the Roadway. You should understand what students should do when exiting a school bus and crossing the street in front of the bus. In addition, the school bus driver should understand that students might not always do what they are supposed to do. If a student or students must cross the roadway, they should follow these procedures:
· Walk approximately 10 feet away from the side of the school bus to a position where you can see them.
· Walk to a location at least 10 feet in front of the right corner of the bumper, but still remaining away from the front of the school bus.
Stop at the right edge of the roadway. You should be able to see the student's feet. When students reach the edge of the roadway, they should:
1. Stop and look in all directions, making sure the roadway is clear and is safe.
2. Check to see if the red flashing lights on the bus are still flashing.
3. Wait for your signal before crossing the roadway.
Upon your signal, the students should:
1. Cross far enough in front of the school bus to be in your view.
2. Stop at the left edge of the school bus, stop, and look again for your signal to continue to cross the roadway.
3. Look for traffic in both directions, making sure roadway is clear.
4. Proceed across the roadway, continuing to look in all directions.
Note: The school bus driver should enforce any state or local regulations or recommendations concerning student actions outside the school bus.
