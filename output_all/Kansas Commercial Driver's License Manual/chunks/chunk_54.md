## Look at the Gauges
1. Oil pressure. Should come up to normal within seconds after engine is started. See Figure 2.5
2. Air pressure. Pressure should build from 50 to 90 psi within 3 minutes. Build air pressure to governor cut-out (usually around 120 - 140 psi. Know your vehicle's requirements.
3. Ammeter and/or voltmeter. Should be in normal range(s).
4. Coolant temperature. Should begin gradual rise to normal operating range.
5. Engine oil temperature. Should begin gradual rise to normal operating range.
6. Warning lights and buzzers. Oil, coolant, charging circuit warning, and antilock brake system lights should go out right away.
