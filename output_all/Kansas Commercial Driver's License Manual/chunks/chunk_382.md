## 10.6.3 - Braking with ABS
When you drive a vehicle with ABS, you should brake as you always have. In other words:
· Use only the braking force necessary to stop safely and stay in control.
· Brake the same way, regardless of whether you have ABS on the bus. However, in emergency braking, do not pump the brakes on a bus with ABS.
· As you slow down, monitor your bus and back off the brakes (if it is safe to do so) to stay in control.
