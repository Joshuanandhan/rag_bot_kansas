## Mounts
Look for cracked or broken spring hangers, missing or damaged bushings, and broken, loose, or missing bolts, u-bolts or other axle mounting parts. (The mounts should be checked at each point where they are secured to the vehicle frame and axle[s]).
Shock Absorbers See that shock absorbers are secure and that there are no leaks.
Note: Be prepared to perform the same suspension components inspection on every axle (power unit and trailer, if equipped).
11.2.3 - Brakes
Slack Adjustors and Pushrods Look for broken, loose, or missing parts. For manual slack adjustors, the brake pushrod should not move more than one inch (with the brakes released) when pulled by hand.
