## 2.5 - Communicating
## 2.5.1 - Signal Your Intentions
Other drivers can't know what you are going to do until you tell them. Signaling what you intend to do is important for safety.
Here are some general rules for signaling.
Turns. There are three good rules for using turn signals:
1. Signal early. Signal well before you turn. It is the best way to keep others from trying to pass you.
2. Signal continuously. You need both hands on the wheel to turn safely. Don't cancel the signal until you have completed the turn.
3. Cancel your signal. Don't forget to turn off your turn signal after you've turned (if you don't have self-canceling signals).
Lane Changes. Put your turn signal on before changing lanes. Change lanes slowly and smoothly. That way a driver you didn't see may have a chance to honk his/her horn or avoid your vehicle.
Slowing Down. Warn drivers behind you when you see you'll need to slow down. A few light taps on the brake pedal -- enough to flash the brake lights -- should warn following drivers. Use the four-way emergency flashers for times when you are driving very slowly or are stopped. Warn other drivers in any of the following situations:
Trouble Ahead. The size of your vehicle may make it hard for drivers behind you to see hazards ahead. If you see a hazard that will require slowing down, warn the drivers behind by flashing your brake lights. Tight Turns. Most car drivers don't know how slowly you have to go to make a tight turn in a large vehicle. Give drivers behind you warning by braking early and slowing gradually.
Stopping on the Road. Truck and bus drivers sometimes stop in the roadway to unload cargo or passengers, or to stop at a railroad crossing. Warn following drivers by flashing your brake lights. Don't stop suddenly.
Driving Slowly. Drivers often do not realize how fast they are catching up to a slow vehicle until they are very close. If you must drive slowly, alert following drivers by turning on your emergency flashers if it is legal. (Laws regarding the use of flashers differ from one state to another. Check the laws of the states where you will drive.)
Don't Direct Traffic. Some drivers try to help out others by signaling when it is safe to pass. You should not do this. You could cause an accident. You could be blamed, and it could cost you many thousands of dollars.
