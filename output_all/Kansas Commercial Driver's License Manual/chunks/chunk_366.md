## 10.2.2 - Loading Procedures
Perform a safe stop as described in subsection 10.2.1.
· Students should wait in a designated location for the school bus, facing the bus as it approaches.
· Students should board the bus only when signaled by the driver.
· Monitor all mirrors continuously.
· Count the number of students at the bus stop and be sure all board the bus. If possible, know names of students at each stop. If there is a student missing, ask the other students where the student is.
· Have the students board the school bus slowly, in single file, and use the handrail. The dome light should be on while loading in the dark.
· Wait until students are seated and facing forward before moving the bus.
· Check all mirrors. Make certain no one is running to catch the bus.
. If you cannot account for a student outside, secure the bus, take the key, and check around and underneath the bus.
When all students are accounted for, prepare to leave by:
1. Closing the door.
2. Engaging the transmission.
3. Releasing the parking brake.
4. Turning off alternating flashing red lights.
5. Turning on left turn signal.
6. Checking all mirrors again.
7. Allowing congested traffic to disperse.
8. When it is safe, move the bus to enter traffic flow and continue the route.
9. The loading procedure is essentially the same wherever you load students, but there are slight differences. When students are loading at the school campus, you should:
10. Turn off the ignition switch.
11. Remove key if leaving driver's compartment.
12. Position yourself to supervise loading as required or recommended by your state or local regulations.
