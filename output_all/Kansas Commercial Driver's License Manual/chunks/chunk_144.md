## 2.19.2 - Correcting a Drive-wheel Braking Skid
Do the following to correct a drive-wheel braking skid. Stop Braking. This will let the rear wheels roll again and keep the rear wheels from sliding. Counter-steer. As a vehicle turns back on course, it has a tendency to keep on turning. Unless you turn the steering wheel quickly the other way, you may find yourself skidding in the opposite direction. Learning to stay off the brake, turn the steering wheel quickly, push in the clutch, and counter-steer in a skid takes a lot of practice. The best place to get this practice is on a large driving range or "skid pad."
