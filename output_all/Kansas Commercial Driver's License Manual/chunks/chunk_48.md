## Wheel and Rim Problems
· Damaged rims.
· Rust around wheel nuts may mean the nuts are loose -- check tightness. After a tire has been changed, stop a short while later and re-check tightness of nuts.
· Missing clamps, spacers, studs, or lugs means danger.
· Mismatched, bent, or cracked lock rings are dangerous.
· Wheels or rims that have had welding repairs are not safe.
