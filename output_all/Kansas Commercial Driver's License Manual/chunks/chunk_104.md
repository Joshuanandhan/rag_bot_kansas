## 2.9 - Distracted Driving
A driver distraction is anything that takes your attention away from driving. Whenever you are driving a vehicle and your full attention is not on the driving task, you are putting yourself, your passengers, other vehicles, and pedestrians in danger. Distracted driving can cause collisions, resulting in injury, death or property damage.
Activities inside of the vehicle that can distract your attention include: talking to passengers; adjusting the radio, CD player or climate controls; eating, drinking or smoking; reading maps or other literature; picking up something that fell; talking on a cell phone or CB radio; reading or sending text messages; using any type of telematic or electronic devices (such as navigation systems, pagers, personal digital assistant, computers, etc.); daydreaming or being occupied with other mental distractions; and many others.
Possible distractions that could occur outside a moving vehicle: outside traffic, vehicles, or pedestrians; outside events such as police pulling someone over or a crash scene; sunlight/sunset; objects in roadway; road construction; reading billboards or other road advertisements; and many others.
