## Vehicle Inspection Guide
Step 1: Vehicle Overview
Review Last Vehicle Inspection Report. Drivers may have to make a vehicle inspection report in writing each day. The motor carrier must repair any items in the report that affect safety and certify on the report that repairs were made or were unnecessary. You must sign the report only if defects were noted and certified to be repaired or not needed to be repaired.
Step 2: Check Engine Compartment
1. Check That the Parking Brakes Are On and/or Wheels Chocked.
2. You may have to raise the hood, tilt the cab (secure loose things so they don't fall and break something), or open the engine compartment door.
Check the following:
3. Engine oil level.
4. Coolant level in radiator; condition of hoses.
5. Power steering fluid level; hose condition (if so equipped).
6. Windshield washer fluid level.
7. Battery fluid level, connections, and tie downs (battery may be located elsewhere)
8. Automatic transmission fluid level (may require engine to be running).
9. Check belts for tightness and excessive wear (alternator, water pump, air compressor) -- learn how much "give" the belts should have when adjusted right and check each one.
10. Leaks in the engine compartment (fuel, coolant, oil, power steering fluid, hydraulic fluid, battery fluid).
11. Cracked, worn electrical wiring insulation.
12. Lower and secure hood, cab, or engine compartment door.
Step 3: Start Engine and Inspect Inside the Cab
1. Get in and Start Engine
2. Make sure parking brake is on.
3. Put gearshift in neutral (or "park" if automatic).
4. Start engine; listen for unusual noises.
5. If equipped, check the Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) indicator lights. Light on dash should come on and then turn off. If it stays on the ABS is not working properly. For trailers only, if the yellow light on the left rear of the trailer stays on, the ABS is not working properly.
