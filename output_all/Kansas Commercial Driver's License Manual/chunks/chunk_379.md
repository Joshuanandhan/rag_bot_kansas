## 10.5.2 - Handling Serious Problems
Tips on handling serious problems:
1. Follow your school's procedures for discipline or refusal of rights to ride the bus.
2. Stop the bus. Park in a safe location off the road, perhaps a parking lot or a driveway.
3. Secure the bus. Take the ignition key with you if you leave your seat.
4. Stand up and speak respectfully to the offender or offenders. Speak in a courteous manner with a firm voice. Remind the offender of the expected behavior. Do not show anger, but do show that you mean business.
5. If a change of seating is needed, request that the student move to a seat near you.
6. Never put a student off the bus except at school or at his or her designated school bus stop. If you feel that the offense is serious enough that you cannot safely drive the bus, call for a school administrator or the police to come and remove the student.
Always follow your state or local procedures for requesting assistance.
