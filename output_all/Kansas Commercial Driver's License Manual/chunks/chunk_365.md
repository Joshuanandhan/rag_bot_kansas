## 10.2.1 - Approaching the Stop
Each school district establishes official routes and official school bus stops. All stops should be approved by the school district prior to making the stop. You should never change the location of a bus stop without written approval from the appropriate school district official. You must use extreme caution when approaching a school bus stop. You are in a very demanding situation when entering these areas. It is critical that you understand and follow all state and local laws and regulations regarding approaching a school bus stop. This would involve the proper use of mirrors, alternating flashing lights, and when equipped, the moveable stop signal arm and crossing control arm.
When approaching the stop, you should:
· Approach cautiously at a slow rate of speed.
· Look for pedestrians, traffic, or other objects before, during, and after coming to a stop.
· Continuously check all mirrors.
· If the school bus is so equipped, activate alternating flashing amber warning lights at least 200 feet or approximately 5-10 seconds before the school bus stop or in accordance with state law.
· Turn on right turn signal indicator about 100-300 feet or approximately 3-5 seconds before pulling over.
· Continuously check mirrors to monitor the danger zones for students, traffic, and other objects.
· Move as far as possible to the right on the traveled portion of the roadway.
· When stopping you should:
· Bring school bus to a full stop with the front bumper at least 10 feet away from students at the designated stop. This forces the students to walk to the bus so you have a better view of their movements.
· Place transmission in Park, or if there is no Park shift point, in Neutral and set the parking brake at each stop.
· Activate alternating red lights when traffic is a safe distance from the school bus and ensure stop arm is extended.
. Make a final check to see that all traffic has stopped before completely opening the door and signaling students to approach.
