A Qualified Vehicle is (except as provided below) any Power Unit that is used or intended for use in two or more Member Jurisdictions and that is used for the transportation of persons for hire or designed, used, or maintained primarily for the transportation of property, and:
I. has two Axles and a gross Vehicle weight or registered gross Vehicle weight in
II. excess of 26,000 pounds (11,793.401 kilograms), or
III. has three or more Axles, regardless of weight, or
IV. is used in combination, when the gross Vehicle weight of such combination exceeds 26,000 pounds (11,793.401 kilograms).
While similar, the Qualified Motor Vehicle in IFTA means a motor vehicle used, designed, or maintained for transportation of persons or property and:
1. Having two axles and a gross vehicle weight or registered gross vehicle weight exceeding 26,000 pounds or 11,797 kilograms; or
2. Is used in combination, when the weight of such combination exceeds 26,000 pounds or 11,797 kilograms gross vehicle or registered gross vehicle weight. Qualified Motor Vehicle does not include recreational vehicles.
If the vehicle you operate is registered under IRP and you are a motor carrier licensed under IFTA, then you are required to comply with the mandatory record keeping requirements for operating the vehicle. A universally accepted method of capturing this information is through the completion of an Individual Vehicle Distance Record (IVDR), sometimes times referred to as a Driver Trip Report. This document reflects the distance traveled and fuel purchased for a vehicle that operates interstate under apportioned (IRP) registration and IFTA fuel tax credentials. Although the actual format of the IVDR may vary, the information that is required for proper record keeping does not.
In order to satisfy the requirements for Individual Vehicle Distance Records, these documents must include the following information:
I. Distance
II. Per Article IV of the IRP Plan
III. Date of trip (starting and ending)
IV. Trip origin and destination - City and State or Province
V. Route(s) of travel
VI. Beginning and ending odometer or hubometer reading of the trip
VII. Total distance traveled
VIII. In-Jurisdiction distance
IX. Power unit number or vehicle identification number
Fuel
Per Section P560 of the IFTA Procedures Manual .300 An acceptable receipt or invoice must include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
.005 Date of purchase
.010 Seller's name and address .015 Number of gallons or liters purchased; .020 Fuel type .025 Price per gallon or liter or total amount of sale
.030 Unit number or another unique vehicle identifier .035 Purchaser's name
An example of an IVDR that must be completed in its entirety for each trip can be found in Figure 1 below. Each individual IVDR should be filled out for only one vehicle. The rules to follow when trying to determine how and when to log an odometer reading are the following:
· At the beginning of the day
· When leaving the state or province
. At the end of the trip/day
Not only do the trips need to be logged, but the fuel purchases need to be documented as well. You must obtain a receipt for all fueling and include it with your completed IVDR. Make sure that any trips that you enter are always filled out in descending order and that your trips include all state/provinces that you traveled through on your route. There are different routes that a driver may take, and most of the miles may be within one state or province. Whether or not the distance you travel is primarily in one jurisdiction or spread among several jurisdictions, all information for the trip must be recorded. This includes the dates, the routes, odometer readings and fuel purchases. By completing this document in full and keeping all records required by both the IRP and the IFTA, you will have ensured that you and your company are incompliance with all State and Provincial laws surrounding fuel and distance record keeping requirements.
The IVDR serves as the source document for the calculation of fees and taxes that are payable to the jurisdictions in which the vehicle is operated, so these original records must be maintained for a minimum
of four years. In addition, these records are subject to audit by the taxing jurisdictions. Failure to maintain complete and accurate records could result in fines, penalties and suspension or revocation of IRP registrations and IFTA licenses.
