## Where to Steer.
· If an oncoming driver has drifted into your lane, a move to your right is best. If that driver realizes what has happened, the natural response will be to return to his or her own lane.
· If something is blocking your path, the best direction to steer will depend on the situation.
· If you have been using your mirrors, you'll know which lane is empty and can be safely used.
· If the shoulder is clear, going right may be best. No one is likely to be driving on the shoulder, but someone may be passing you on the left. You will know if you have been using your mirrors.
. If you are blocked on both sides, a move to the right may be best. At least you won't force anyone into an opposing traffic lane and a possible head-on collision.
Leaving the Road. In some emergencies, you may have to drive off the road. It may be less risky than facing a collision with another vehicle.
Most shoulders are strong enough to support the weight of a large vehicle and, therefore, offer an available escape route. Here are some guidelines if you do leave the road.
· Avoid Braking. If possible, avoid using the brakes until your speed has dropped to about 20 mph. Then brake very gently to avoid skidding on a loose surface.
· Keep One Set of Wheels on the Pavement, if Possible. This helps to maintain control.
· Stay on the Shoulder. If the shoulder is clear, stay on it until your vehicle has come to a stop. Signal and check your mirrors before pulling back onto the road.
Returning to the Road. If you are forced to return to the road before you can stop, use the following procedure:
· Hold the wheel tightly and turn sharply enough to get right back on the road safely. Don't try to edge gradually back on the road. If you do, your tires might grab unexpectedly, and you could lose control.
· When both front tires are on the paved surface, counter-steer immediately. The two turns should be made as a single "steer-counter-steer" move.
