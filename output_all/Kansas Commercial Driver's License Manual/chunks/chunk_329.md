## 9.3.11 - Placard Tables
There are two placard tables, Table 1 and Table 2. Table 1 materials must be placarded whenever any amount is transported. See Figure 9.7.
Except for bulk packaging, the hazard classes in Table 2 need placards only if the total amount transported is 1,001 pounds or more including the package. Add the amounts from all shipping papers for all the Table 2 products you have on board. See Figure 9.8.
_Placard Table 1 Any Amount_
| IF YOUR VEHICLE CONTAINS ANY AMOUNT OF...... | PLACARD AS... |
|---|---|
| 1.1 Mass Explosives | Explosives 1.1 |
| 1.2 Project Hazards | Explosives 1.2 |
| 1.3 Mass Fire Hazards | Explosives 1.3 |
| 2.3 Poisonous/Toxic Gases | Poison Gas |
| 4.3 Dangerous When Wet | Dangerous When Wet |
| 5.2 (Organic Peroxide, Type B, liquid or solid, Temperature controlled) | Organic Peroxide |
| 6.1 (Inhalation hazard zone A & B only) | Poison/toxic inhalation |
| 7 (Radioactive Yellow III label only) | Radioactive |
Figure 9.7
You may use DANGEROUS placards instead of separate placards for each Table 2 hazard class when: You have 1,001 pounds or more of two or more Table 2 hazard classes in non-bulk packages, requiring different placards, and you have not loaded 2,205 pounds or more of any Table 2 hazard class material at any one place. (You must use the specific placard for this material.) The dangerous placard is an option, not a requirement. You can always placard for the materials.
If the words INHALATION HAZARD are on the shipping paper or package, you must display POISON GAS or POISON INHALATION placards in addition to any other placards needed by the product's hazard class. The 1,000-pound exception does not apply to these materials.
Materials with a secondary hazard of dangerous when wet must display the DANGEROUS WHEN WET placard in addition to any other placards needed by the product's hazard class. The 1,000-pound exception to placarding does not apply to these materials.

Figure 9.8
Placards used to identify the primary or subsidiary hazard class of a material must have the hazard class or division number displayed in the lower corner of the placard. Permanently affixed subsidiary hazard placards without the hazard class number may be used as long as they stay within color specifications. Placards may be displayed for hazardous materials even if not required so long as the placard identifies the hazard of the material being transported.
Bulk packaging is a single container with a capacity greater than 119 gallons. A bulk package, and a vehicle transporting a bulk package, must be placarded, even if it only has the residue of a hazardous material. Certain bulk packages only have to be placarded on the two opposite sides or may display labels. All other bulk packages must be placarded on all four sides.
