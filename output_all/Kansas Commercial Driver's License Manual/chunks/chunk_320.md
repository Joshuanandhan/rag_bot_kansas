## 9.3.3 - Lists of Regulated Products
Placards. Placards are used to warn others of hazardous materials. Placards are signs put on the outside of a vehicle and on bulk packages, which identify the hazard class of the cargo. A placarded vehicle must have at least four identical placards. They are put on the front, rear, and both sides of the vehicle. See Figure 9.3. Placards must be readable from all four directions. They are at least 250mm 9.84 inches square, square-on-point, in a diamond shape. Cargo tanks and other bulk packaging display the identification number of their contents on placards or orange panels or white square-on-point displays that are the same size as placards.

Examples of HAZMAT Placards. Figure 9.3 Identification numbers are a four-digit code used by first responders to identify hazardous materials. An identification number may be used to identify more than one chemical. The letters "NA or "UN" will
precede the identification number. The United States Department of Transportation's Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) lists the chemicals and the identification numbers assigned to them.
There are three main lists used by shippers, carriers, and drivers when trying to identify hazardous materials. Before transporting a material, look for its name on three lists. Some materials are on all lists, others on only one. Always check the following lists:
1. Section 172.101, the Hazardous Materials Table.
2. Appendix A to Section 172.101, the List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities.
3. Appendix B to Section 172.101, the List of Marine Pollutants.
The Hazardous Materials Table. Figure 9.4 shows part of the Hazardous Materials Table.
Column 1 tells which shipping mode(s) the entry affects and other information concerning the shipping description. The next five columns show each material's shipping name, hazard class or division, identification number, packaging group, and required labels.
Six different symbols may appear in Column 1 of the table.
(+) Shows the proper shipping name, hazard class, and packing group to use, even if the material doesn't meet the hazard class definition.
(A) Means the hazardous material described in Column 2 is subject to the HMR only when offered or intended for transport by air unless it is a hazardous substance or hazardous waste.
(W) Means the hazardous material described in Column 2 is subject to the HMR only when offered or intended for transportation by water unless it is a hazardous substance, hazardous waste, or marine pollutant.
(D) Means the proper shipping name is appropriate for describing materials for domestic transportation, but may not be proper for international transportation.
(I) Identifies a proper shipping name that is used to describe materials in international transportation. A different shipping name may be used when only domestic transportation is involved.
(G) Means this hazardous material described in Column 2 is a generic shipping name. A generic shipping name must be accompanied by a technical name on the shipping paper. A technical name is a specific chemical that makes the product hazardous.
Column 2 lists the proper shipping names and descriptions of regulated materials. Entries are in alphabetical order so you can more quickly find the right entry. The table shows proper shipping names in regular type. The shipping paper must show proper shipping names. Names shown in italics are not proper shipping names.
