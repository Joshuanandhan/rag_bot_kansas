## 9.4.1 - General Loading Requirements
Before loading or unloading, set the parking brake. Make sure the vehicle will not move. Many products become more hazardous when exposed to heat. Load hazardous materials away from heat sources.
Watch for signs of leaking or damaged containers: LEAKS SPELL TROUBLE! Do not transport leaking packages. Depending on the material, you, your truck, and others could be in danger. It is illegal to move a vehicle with leaking hazardous materials.
Containers of hazardous materials must be braced to prevent movement of the packages during transportation.
No Smoking. When loading or unloading hazardous materials, keep fire away. Don't let people smoke nearby. Never smoke around:
· Class 1 (Explosives)
· Class 2.1 (Flammable Gas )
· Class 3 (Flammable Liquids)
· Class 4 (Flammable Solids)
· Class 5 (Oxidizers)
Secure Against Movement. Brace containers so they will not fall, slide, or bounce around during transportation. Be very careful when loading containers that have valves or other fittings. All hazardous materials packages must be secured during transportation.
After loading, do not open any package during your trip. Never transfer hazardous materials from one package to another while in transit. You may empty a cargo tank, but do not empty any other package while it is on the vehicle.
Cargo Heater Rules. There are special cargo heater rules for loading:
· Class 1 (Explosives)
· Class 2.1 (Flammable Gas)
· Class 3 (Flammable Liquids)
The rules usually forbid use of cargo heaters, including automatic cargo heater/air conditioner units. Unless you have read all the related rules, don't load the above products in a cargo space that has a heater.
Use Closed Cargo Space. You cannot have overhang or tailgate loads of:
· Class 1 (Explosives)
· Class 4 (Flammable Solids)
· Class 5 (Oxidizers)
You must load these hazardous materials into a closed cargo space unless all packages are:
· Fire and water resistant.
· Covered with a fire and water-resistant tarp.
