## 4.3.5 - Railroad-highway Crossing/ Stops
Stop at RR Crossings:
1. Stop your bus between 15 and 50 feet before railroad crossings.
2. Listen and look in both directions for trains. You should open your forward door if it improves your ability to see or hear an approaching train.
3. Before crossing after a train has passed, make sure there isn't another train coming in the other direction on other tracks.
If your bus has a manual transmission, never change gears while crossing the tracks.
You do not have to stop, but must slow down and carefully check for other vehicles:
路 At streetcar crossings.
路 Where a policeman or flagman is directing traffic.
路 If a traffic signal is green.
路 At crossings marked as "exempt" or "abandoned."
