## 6.1.4 - Railroad-highway Crossings
Railroad-highway crossings can also cause problems, particularly when pulling trailers with low underneath clearance.
These trailers can get stuck on raised crossings:
Low slung units (lowboy, car carrier, moving van, possum-belly livestock trailer). Single-axle tractor pulling a long trailer with its landing gear set to accommodate a tandem-axle tractor.
If for any reason you get stuck on the tracks, get out of the vehicle and away from the tracks. Check signposts or signal housing at the crossing for emergency notification information. Call 911 or other
emergency number. Give the location of the crossing using all identifiable landmarks, especially the DOT number, if posted.
