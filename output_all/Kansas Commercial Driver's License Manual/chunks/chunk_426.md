## 11.6.2 - Class B and C Vehicle Inspection Test
If you are applying for a Class B CDL, you will be required to perform one of the three versions of a Vehicle inspection in the vehicle you have brought with you for testing. Each of the three tests are equivalent and you will not know which test you will take until just before the testing begins. All of the tests include an engine start and an in-cab inspection. Then, your test may require an inspection of the entire vehicle or only a portion of the vehicle which your CDL Examiner will explain to you. You will also have to inspect any special features of your vehicle (e.g, school or transit bus).
