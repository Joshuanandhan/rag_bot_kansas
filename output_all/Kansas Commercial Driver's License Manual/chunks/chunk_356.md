· A maximum net mass greater than 400 kg (882 pounds) or a maximum capacity greater than 450 L (119 gallons) as a receptacle for a solid; or
· A water capacity greater than 454 kg (1000 pounds) as a receptacle for a gas as defined in Sec. 173.115.
Cargo tank - A bulk packaging which:
· Is a tank intended primarily for the carriage of liquids or gases and includes appurtenances, reinforcements, fittings, and closures (for "tank", see 49 CFR 178.345 1(c), 178.337 1, or 178.338 1, as applicable);

Carrier - A person who transports passengers or property in commerce by rail car, aircraft, motor vehicle or vessel.
Consignee - The business or person to whom a shipment is delivered.
Division - A subdivision of a hazard class.
EPA - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Freight container - a reusable container having a volume of 64 cubic feet or more, designed and constructed to permit being lifted with its contents intact and intended primarily for containment of packages (in unit form) during transportation.
Fuel tank - A tank, other than a cargo tank, used to transport flammable or combustible liquid or compressed gas for the purpose of supplying fuel for propulsion of the transport vehicle to which it is attached, or for the operation of other equipment on the transport vehicle.
Gross weight or gross mass - The weight of the packaging plus the weight of its contents.
Hazard class - The category of hazard assigned to a hazardous material under the definitional criteria of Part 173 and the provisions of the Sec. 172.101 Table. A material may meet the defining criteria for more than one hazard class but is assigned to only one hazard class.
Hazardous materials - A substance or material which has been determined by the Secretary of Transportation to be capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health, safety, and property when transported in commerce, and which has been so designated. The term includes hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, marine pollutants, elevated temperature materials and materials designated as hazardous in the hazardous materials table of §172.101, and materials that meet the defining criteria for hazard classes and divisions in §173, subchapter c of this chapter.
Hazardous substance - A material, including its mixtures and solutions, that: Is listed in Appendix A to Sec. 172.101;
Is in a quantity, in one package, which equals or exceeds the reportable quantity (RQ) listed in Appendix A to Sec. 172.101; and When in a mixture or solution
For radionuclides, conforms to paragraph 7 of Appendix A to Sec. 172.101. For other than radionuclides, is in a concentration by weight which equals or exceeds the concentration corresponding to the RQ of the material, as shown in Figure 9.12.
**Hazardous Substance Concentrations by Weight**

| RQ Pounds (Kilograms) | Percent | PPM |
|---|---|---|
| 5,000 (2,270) | 10 | 100,000 |
